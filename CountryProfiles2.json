                    "Brief history and other relevant background information": "OVERVIEW OF INDIAN STATISTICAL SYSTEM\nThe Indian Statistical System functions within the overall administrative set up of the country.  India has a federal structure of Government.  The division of responsibility for administration between the Union Government and the State Governments is on the basis of three-fold classification of all subjects, namely,  the Union List, the State List,  and the Concurrent List.  The last category represents the areas where both the Union and State Governments can operate.  The subject Statistics is in this list, but conduct of surveys is in the Union List.  There is a further division of responsibility, by subjects or groups of subjects, among the different Ministries/Departments of the Union Government and among the Departments of State Governments, respectively, on the basis of their administrative functions.\n\nIn accordance with this structure, the Indian Statistical System is both decentralised and centralised. Large-scale statistical operations such as Population Census, Economic Census, Agricultural Census and Livestock Census and nation-wide sample surveys including the Annual Survey of Industries and the Socio-Economic surveys, as well as, compilation of macro-economic aggregates like national accounts, price indices and industrial production, are largely Central activities. The State Governments and statistical organisations of the States also collect and generate data on a number of variables.  \n\nThe Central Government acts as the coordinating agency for presentation of statistics on an all-India basis even in fields where the States have the primary authority and responsibility for collection of statistics.  The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation  is the nodal agency for all statistical activities at all-India level.  The State Directorates of Economics and Statistics (DESs) carry out the responsibility of coordination of all statistical activities at the State level and keeping liaison with the MOSPI for the purpose of coordination at all-India level.\n\nEVOLUTION OF MOSPI\nThe Central Statistical Organisation (CSO), which was initially set up as a Statistical Unit in the Cabinet Secretariat in 1949, became an independent organization in 1951.  Subsequently, the National Sample Survey was set up as a fact-finding body in 1950.  In 1961, a full-fledged Department of Statistics was created covering the CSO and the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO).   The Computer Centre providing common service electronic data processing facilities was set up as an attached office of the Department of Statistics in 1966.  In 1973, the Department of Statistics was transferred to the Ministry of Planning, to ensure effective coordination between planning and statistical activities.  In February, 1999, the Department of Statistics and the Department of Programme Implementation were merged to form the Department of Statistics and Programme Implementation and in October, 1999, the Department of Statistics and Programme Implementation became the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation.\n\nThe Ministry has two wings, one relating to Statistics and the other is Programme Implementation. The Statistics Wing consists of the Central Statistical Organisation (CSO), the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) and the Computer Centre. The Programme Implementation Wing has four Divisions, namely, (i) Twenty Point Programme Division, (ii) Infrastructure Monitoring Division, (iii) Project Monitoring Division and (iv) Member of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme Division.The Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), which is a premier statistical institute, receives budgetary support from the MOSPI.\n\nThe Government of India Resolution of 1st June 2005 proposes to set up a Statutory Commission, namely, the National Statistical Commission (NSC) consisting of a part-time Chairperson, four part-time Members, one each from the fields (a) economic statistics; (b) social and environment statistics; (c) censuses and surveys; and (d) national accounts and state statistical systems, and Secretary, Planning Commission as Members.  The Chief Statistician of India would serve as Secretary to the NSC.\n\nAlongwith the establishment of the NSC, the CSO and the NSSO will be merged into the National Statistical Organisation (NSO), to be headed by the Chief Statistician of India (CSI).  The NSO will have two wings, namely, (i) Central Statistics Office (CSO) and (ii) National Sample Survey Office (NSSO)."

The other most important Act for collection of statistics on demographic aspects of population is the \u2018Population Census Act 1948\u2019, which is administered by the Office of the Registral Genral of India, functioning  under the Ministry of Home Affairs.  Besides these two important Acts, there are a number of Acts, Rules and Procedures being administered by various administrative  agencies on their subjects, through which statutory returns are collected  by these Ministries/Departments. \n\nCollection of Statistics Act 1953\nThe Collection of Statistics Act 1953 empowers the Centre as well as State Governments to collect statistics in regard to any matter concerning industry or class of industries, commercial trading and industrial concerns including factories and matters relating to welfare of labour and condition of labour.  The MOSPI collects data on manufacturing establishments through the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI), using the Provisions of this Act.  \n\nThis Act specifies that the Central and State Government may appoint a statistical Authority, who in turn, may serve, on the owner of an industrial or a commercial concern or an individual, a notice requiring him/her to furnish certain  listed information about the industrial unit.  It confers the right   of access to relevant records or documents and restricts publication of any information  disclosing the identity of the industrial unit.

The Act empowers the Central Government to take a Population Census of the country after duly notifying its intention to do so.  It empowers the Central Government to appoint Census Commissioner and State Governments Census officers to take the census.  The Census Act is utilized for fixing primary administrative responsibility, for obtaining necessary funds, for determining the general scope and timing of the Census, for placing a legal obligation upon the people to give truthful answers, and for placing a legal obligation upon the enumerator to record the responses faithfully.  While the Act makes it obligatory for the public to answer all questions faithfully, simultaneously, it guarantees confidentiality of information in respect of individuals.  It provides penalties for (a) census officers if they fail in their official work and (b) the respondents if they provide wrong information.

Registration of birth, death,\nmarriage and divorce by the Department required the establishment of an organization responsible for\ncollection of information on the country's population. This led to the approval of a regulation in 1924, the\ndepartment responsible for statistics and its duties was determined and responsibility for collection and\ncentralization of necessary statistics was entrusted to the Ministry of the Interior.\nIn June 1939, the first census law was approved by National Council Parliament. Based on the law, put\ninto effect from March 1940, the population census was taken only in Tehran, and in 1940 and 1941, 33\ncities were gradually enumerated. In March 1952, Cooperation Organization of Public Statistics was\nestablished. Statistics and census law was approved in April 1958. In that year, Department of Statistics\nand Census detached from the General Department of Statistics and Civil Registration and joined the\nCooperation Organization of Public Statistics. Thus, for the first time, an organization, exclusively\nresponsible for collection of statistics, was established and was renamed Department of Public Statistics\naffiliated to the Ministry of the Interior in 1956.\nThe Department implemented the first national census of population and housing in 1956. Upon\nestablishment of the Department of Public Statistics, statistical activities entered a new stage and different\nkinds of surveys were annually executed in different socio-economic areas the most important of which\nare as follows:\n- Agriculture Survey in 1960\n- Population Sample Survey in 1963\n- Manufacturing Establishments Census in 1963\n- Household Budget Survey in 1963\nAccording to the 1965 Law and due to increasing requirements of planning organizations for information\nand statistics as well as the necessity of very close collaboration of main organization producing statistics\nwith the planning organizations, the Department of Public Statistics was detached from the Ministry of\nthe Interior and transformed into the Statistical Center of Iran (SCI) affiliated to the then Plan and Budget\nOrganization.\nIn 2000, the Plan and Budget Organization and the State Organization for Employment and\nAdministrative Affairs merged together into Management and Planning Organization, to which the SCI is\nnow affiliated. In 2007, Organization of Management and Planning changed to Vice Presidency of\nPlanning and Strategic Supervision. In 2014, Vice Presidency of planning and Strategic Supervision and\nVice Presidency for Management and Human Capital was merged together into Management and\nPlanning Organization.\nAt present, Statistical Centre of Iran is affiliated to the Management and Planning Organization."

It also serves the needs of the wider national and international community (i.e. business, EU, international organisations, media, researchers, and the public generally) for impartial and relevant information on social and economic conditions. Particular attention is paid to the specialist needs of business and the research/academic community for more detailed and focused data. This mandate is encapsulated in the following Mission Statement that appears in the CSO's 2004-2006 Corporate Plan: Statistics for a Modern Ireland, The efficient and timely provision of high quality information needed by a changing society."

Every year the Prime Minister provides the Parliament with a detailed report on ISTAT activities.\n\nISTAT President is bound to answer the observations and remarks  of  the Commission for the protection of  Statistical Information. the Commission supervises the impartiality and completeness of statistical information, the quality of methodologies, the compliance of surveys with EU and international directives and is established within the Presidency of the Council of Ministers.\n\nThe production of adequate public statistical information needs independence from political influences and from pressure of organised interests, clear aims, strict methodology, and full awareness of the citizens' needs and rights. To carry out these principles, the legislative decree n.322/89 has established within the Office of the Premier a Commission for guaranteeing statistical information.\n\nThe Commission supervises the information's impartiality and completeness, the quality of statistical methodologies and information technology systems used to collect, store and spread data, and the compliance of the surveys with the directives of EC bodies and international organizations. The nine members of the Commission, who are appointed every six years and for only one mandate, are designated with the President of the Republic's decree following the Prime Minister's proposal. The Commission meets at least twice a year and draws up a yearly report, which is attached to the Prime Minister's report about Istat's activities and then presented to the Parliament.

The Programme defines the statistical surveys of public interest to be assigned to the National Statistical System and identifies their objectives.\n\nNational Statistical Programme defines the public interest statistical surveys assigned to the National Statistical System, and it is prepared by Istat, decided by the Committee for Directing and Co-ordinating Statistical Information subjected to the opinion of the Commission for Guaranteeing Statistical Information, and, after having consulted the authority on privacy and having received the Cipe's decision, it becomes operative trough a Prime Minister's decree.\n\nAll administrations, authorities and public bodies have to provide the data requested for the surveys indicated in the National Statistical Program (PSN). Private subjects have the same duty only for those surveys established by decree of the President of the Republic. The so-called sensitive data (religious beliefs, political opinions, health conditions) are never included in the obligation to respond.\n\nThe program refers to a period of three years, but it's updated every year. The PSN now in force, is the one decided upon for the years 2002-2004 which includes, on the whole, over one thousand works. EC provisions have a considerable impact on the program: the surveys and the processing which have to be done according to EC regulations and directives are respectively 113 and 101. In addition, 114 works are finalised to the European integration of Sistan's production at a European level. The creation of information systems represents another strategic course of the current Program: there are 151 projects tended to this aim, and 102 of them have been assigned to Istat.\n\nA significant role in preparing and monitoring the PSN is played by the Quality circles: permanent work groups which, sector by sector, involve official statistics producers and users, ensuring a more precise compliance of the surveys to the Italian society's and economic reality's needs.",

                    "Brief history and other relevant background information": "For over three quarters of a century the National Institute of Statistis (Istat) has reflected Italy, interpreting the role of witness of its history and offering statistical information for managing the future of economy and society.\n\nItaly's national statistical institute has been operating for more than 75 years and it is the main producer of the country's official statistics, representing, in a way, its quantitative memory.\n\nSince its birth, in 1926, it has been following Italy's evolution, describing the general phenomena which concern and transform the country. Starting from the second half of the XIX century, when the statistical function belonged to the Ministry of Agriculture at first and then subsequently to other ministries, official statistics offered instruments to verify important aspects of the country's life. And Istat was constituted to systematize and collect information into a coherent context.\n\nRight from the beginning, the Institute appears as an instrument of democracy. The constant publication of the Monthly Bulletin of Statistics gives all citizens access to the main data on the nation's activity. As new information is requested in time, the Institute responds readily. There are many stages in its way to knowledge. One for all: the sample survey concerning the labour forces which, after several local trials and its start on a national scale in 1957, still represents today the main instrument of control for the job market, and it's able to show inequalities and discomfort areas."

The aim of the Act is to promote systematic and efficient development of official statistics: important information to assist the public in making rational decisions, and to ensure the usefulness thereof through specifying basic matters concerning the production and provision of official statistics, and thereby to contribute to the sound development of the national economy and enhancement of the living standards of the citizens.\n\n(2) Basic Plan\nBased on Article 4 of the Statistics Act (Act No.53 of 2007), the Basic Plan Concerning the Development of Official Statistics was established and apporoved by the Cabinet in March 2009, and has also been propelled since the beginning of FY 2009 to promote measures for the development of official statistics comprehensively and systematically.\nIn order to ensure effectiveness of the Basic Plan, a \u201cBasic Plan Promotion Committee\u201d was established in April 2009 comprising the heads of the statistical offices of all ministries, and each office and ministry promotes the measures described in the Basic Plan in a unified manner.\n"

This system is generally advantageous because it enables quick responses to specific statistical requirements. On the other hand, under a decentralized system, it is generally difficult to maintain consistency in statistical activities among different ministries, and also to avoid duplication in the compilation of statistics. Therefore, it is vital that one organization coordinates the Government's statistical activities. The Office of Director-General for Policy Planning (Statistical Standards) performs this key task.\n"

The DoS began its field and office work with a humble number of employees. During that period, basic statistical data covering the socio \u2013 economic aspects in the Kingdom had been produced. One of the most remarkable statistical activities conducted by the DoS was the first Housing Units Census in 1952, then the National Accounts Estimates in addition to the Statistical Yearbook.\n\n \n\nWhile in the Sixties, the DoS conducted the first Population and Housing Units Census in 1961, in addition to the first Multi-Purpose Households Survey. It also issued many publications for the first time such as the Agricultural Statistics and the External Trade Bulletins. It also carried out the Households Expenditure Survey and constructed the Consumer Price Indices. The collected data were used to formulate the seven years socio\u2013economic development program in Jordan (1964\u20131971).\n\n \n\nIn the seventies,  the DoS focused its efforts on carrying out agricultural, industrial, labour forces, population and housing units censuses in addition to sample surveys which covered households, demographic, social and economic topics. The DoS also implemented  the National Fertility Survey for the first time.\n\n \n\nThe decade of the eighties witnessed the comprehensive coverage policy of the economic phenomena by conducting various Agricultural Surveys, the Disabled Survey, the Internal Migration and Returnees Survey. This decade  was characterized by improving various economic statistics in accordance with the rules, standards and recommendations issued by the UN and other international organizations. New surveys were also added to the DoS activities such as the Constructions, Services and Commercial Establishments  Survey.\n\n \n\nThe last decade of the previous century witnessed a big leap in information technology to facilitate the process of extracting the statistical data and employing it in policy making, decision taking and  carrying out specialized studies in various fields.  During the same period, extensive efforts were made in forging links of cooperation and coordination with all national institutions which collect and use statistical data. It allowed to save time, efforts, and money. The DoS also assigned special importance on the process of statistical analysis since it believes in the futility of mere abstract figures. \n\n \n\nDuring the first years of this millennium, the DoS has focused its efforts on enhancement of statistical capacity, including the infrastructures and human resources. It assigned special importance on enhancing statistical awareness among the public which is positively reflected on the quality of statistical products. It also worked on strengthening contacts with data users through employing all available means of communications for maintaining links of trust with them.\n"

                    "Brief history and other relevant background information": "The little available information indicates that Bureau of Statistics (BOS) grew out of a statistical unit of the Ministry of Agriculture around 1964. However, there is an indication that statistical activities in the fields of agriculture and population started long before the birth of the BOS. Lesotho has had decennial censuses of agriculture from 1949 and regular population censuses as far back as 1875. Activities in general statistics surfaced in 1965 when the statistics act of 1965 was passed. This act provides for collection, analysis and dissemination of statistical data and does not make provision for the coordination of statistical activities. It has, however, been informally accepted that BOS is performing that role even without the legal backing. Since that time plans were then afoot to provide that legal backing.\n\nIn 1982, the structure of the BOS included a deputy director who, besides heading the field operation division, oversaw the division and was responsible to the director of statistics. The substantive divisions then were: Trade and Economic statistics, Demography and Social statistics, Data processing. Later on changes were made to accommodate a division responsible for field operation and support services. The position of Deputy Director was re-designated Chief Statistician responsible for the new division of Agricultural Statistics \n\nRegarding personnel, the available information reveal that at the formation of the Bureau of Statistics there was one Director and two Statisticians and in 1967, two years later, the establishment stood at one Director, one Deputy Director, three statistician and four posts of Statistical Officer of which three were filled. During this era, qualified personnel were in short supply and there was inadequate funding to achieve the staff component which would adequately carry out the statistical undertakings enumerated in the Statistics Act 1965. This act has been replaced by the new Bureau of Statistics Act of 2001.\n\nIn 1980, the Data Processing Division came into existence thus ushering in a new occupational group within the statistical service. It is worth mentioning that the group that was ushered into the statistical service did not come from outside, existing staff was retrained.\n\nBOS was recently restructured and got the structure as described above."

They were regulated and budgeted by the respective state governments and each collecting and producing their own statistics. As such, it was often difficult to aggregate these state figures to a \"national\" figure. The governments recognized the need for single national indicators. This need was further compounded by international requests for such information.\n\nIn 1999 a memorandum of understanding (MOU) was signed by the national government and the state governments, centralizing statistical operations under the national office. The statistics offices in the 4 states are now operating under the national budget, statistics collected by these states get sent to the National Statistics Office for compilation, thus producing statistics representing both the States and National Government.\n\nThe National Statistics Office is based at the capital (Palikir) with 8 staff, while branch offices in the 4 states are manned with 3 working staff each.\n\nThe Statistics Office is presently known as the \"Statistics Unit\" within the Department of Economic Affairs. With the new administration, the Unit will become a part of a the newly-formed Office of Statistics, Budget, Overseas Development Assistance and Compact Management."

The historical records and books witness that our ancestors-the Huns counted their livestock and carved on the wood making the number. Later in the 13th century the Mongolian Empire enumerated its population and used the result to levy taxes.\n\nThe basis of official statistics was laid out since the enforcement of Article in the First Constitution of Mongolia which was approved in 1924. The article states to establish and operationalize the statistical activities of the country. The following law the registration division comprised of 6 staff was set up under the Ministry if Internal Affairs in November 11, 1924. As the scope and number of statistical activities increased the structure of statistical system expanded and in 1964 the Central Statistical Office was formed with much wider framework of activities and responsibilities based on a more centralized reporting system.\n\nStarting from 1990 when Mongolia moved to a market economy the statistical and activities faced a challenge of undergoing fundamental reforms towards the operational ones in the newly introduced system. Particularly, from the mid of 1990s several milestone measures were taken to restructure the system in coherence with market economy conditions, adapt and implement international methodologies and principles and deliver more user oriented services. By now, Central Statistical Office was replaced by the National Statistical Office (NSO), Mongolia's official statistical agency, which is under the Parliament in accordance with the statistical law adopted in 1994 and revised in 1997. It has been conducting a number of surveys such as consumer price index survey, LSMS, HIES, RHS, Establishment Survey etc ."

There is no longer a hierarchical relationship between the Minister of Economic Affairs and the organisation. However, the minister is responsible for setting up and maintaining a system for the provision of government statistical information; in other words the minister is politically responsible for legislation and budget, for the creation of conditions for an independent and public production of high quality and reliable statistics. The costs of tasks and activities undertaken to put this legislation into practice are accountable to the government's budget.",
                    "Organizational structure and finance": "The senior management of Statistics Netherlands is assured by an Executive Board, consisting of the Director-General and the Deputy Director-General. There are three statistical divisions: Business Statistics, Social & Spatial Statistics and Macro-Economic Statistics & Dissemination. In addition there is a division for Technology and Facilities. In direct support of the Executive Board are 4 Central Departments: Policy Staff, Operational Management, Facility Services and Personnel & Organization.\n\nIn addition, Statistics Netherlands is also managed by a Central Commission for Statistics (CCS). The CCS is made up of a chairman and an even number of other members totaling no fewer than six and no more than ten. Members are appointed (or a period not exceeding four years, with the possibility of a one-time re-appointment) and dismissed by the Minister of Economic Affairs. The chairman and the other members may not also be civil servants subordinate to the Minister. The CSS has a general oversight function for official statistics in The Netherlands; its duties are among others to foster the provision of statistical information for the government which meets the needs of practice, policy and science, to assess the work programmes of Statistics Netherlands, and to draw up management regulations.",
                    "Multi-annual or annual work program": "In addition to an annual work programme, the Director-General has to submit a multi-annual work programme at least every five years, for approval by the Central Commission of Statistics.",

In addition to its responsibility for (official) national statistics, Statistics Netherlands also has the task of producing European (community) statistics. The legal basis for Statistics Netherlands and its work is the Act of 20 November 2003 governing the central bureau of statistics. The information Statistics Netherlands publishes incorporates a multitude of societal aspects, from macro-economic indicators such as economic growth and consumer prices, to the incomes of individual people and households. Statistics Netherlands' statistical programmes (the long-term statistical programme and the annual work programme) are set by the Central Commission for Statistics. This is an independent commission that watches over the independence, impartiality, relevance, quality and continuity of the statistical programme. The Director-General decides autonomously which methods to use to make these statistics, and whether or not to publish results. \n\nStatistics Netherlands aims to reduce the administrative burden for companies and the public as much as possible. To this end it uses existing administrative registrations of both government and government-funded organisations. The information from these files is supplied to Statistics Netherlands free of charge. Only if they do not contain sufficient information, Statistics Netherlands is allowed to conduct supplementary surveys among companies and private persons. Companies are usually obliged by law to supply information to Statistics Netherlands and can be forced to cooperate under certain circumstances; Statistics Netherlands may use sanctions such as administrative fines. For its part Statistics Netherlands is obliged to keep all individual data confidential. As an exception data sharing with Eurostat, NSIs in EU member states, Dutch Central Bank and academic researches is allowed under certain restructures.\n\nOn 3 January 2004, Statistics Netherlands became an autonomous agency with legal personality.

                    "Access to administrative data": "Statistics New Zealand processes administrative data from other government agencies, notably (i) passenger arrival and departure cards, (ii) birth, death and marriage registrations, and marriage dissolutions, (iii) abortions, (iv) building consents, and (v) income tax records.  It is also increasingly involved in preparing and analysing integrated datasets from a variety of sources, notably in relation to student loans and for the linking of employer and employee data.\n\nStatistics New Zealand has continued to expand the use of administrative data, particularly tax data, to supplement or substitute for existing direct surveys.  Goods and Services Tax (GST) returns to the Inland Revenue Department have been introduced as a component in the redesigned Wholesale Trade Survey, thereby reducing the number of survey respondents by over 600 each quarter (a 36% reduction).  In addition, the use of GST returns in the Quarterly Survey of Manufacturing allowed the number of businesses surveyed to be reduced by 450 (a 28% reduction).  A similar approach is planned for the re-developed Retail Trade Survey in August 2003.  With the re-design it is anticipated that there will be a substantial percentage reduction in businesses surveyed.\n\nChanges proposed for the Annual Business Frame Updating Survey in February 2004 will make use of tax data.  As a consequence, 10,000 fewer firms will be surveyed each year.  The use of tax data is expected to reduce the number of businesses surveyed for the Monthly Business Frame Update Survey by approximately 2000 per month (a 40% reduction).\n\nGood progress has been made on making use of tax data for new statistical series, notably Injury Statistics and the Linked Employer/Employee Database.",
                    "Data confidentiality": "The risk of individual data being inadvertently disclosed is very low, due to the application of strict confidentiality routines in the processing of data for publication.  However, there is provision in the Statistics Act for disclosure of individual data (without the name or address of the respondent) when such disclosure is sought in questionnaires for surveys conducted jointly by Statistics New Zealand and another government agency, and consent to disclosure is given in writing by the respondents concerned."

                    "Brief history and other relevant background information": "Prior to 1947, there was no recognised body responsible for statistical activities in Nigeria although the population census, the most important and oldest statistical exercise in Nigeria, was conducted in 1866 for the municipality of Lagos, based on the Act enacted for that purpose in 1863. Population census and external trade statistics were the first set of official statistics to be developed in Nigeria.\n\nIn 1947 however, a section of the Department of Customs and Excise was established as the nucleus of a full-fledged Department of Statistics enjoying the status of a department (unit of government service then). In 1949, the department was expanded and re-organised on a more permanent basis and a Government Statistician was appointed to head it. In 1960 when ministerial approach to government was adopted, the department was placed under the Federal Office of Statistics (FOS), enjoying the status of an extra-ministerial department. Over the years, changes in the headship of FOS has followed changes in headship of professional cadre in the Federal Civil Service - from Government Statistician in 1949 to Chief Statistician in 1960, Director of Statistics in 1976 and Co-ordinating Director of Statistics in 1984.\n\nDuring its formative years, FOS restricted its activities to administrative statistics such as external trade statistics derived from customs bills of entry. Subsequently, the scope of its activities was widened to include compilation and publication of statistics on internal migration, shipping movement at Nigerian ports, tonnage of cargo carried by rail and sea, etc. In addition, it conducted a number of enquiries into issues such as retail prices, livestock and crop production, household consumption, etc. Most of these enquiries were not based on probability samples. In some cases, only respondents who were willing to participate in an enquiry were approached for interview. The greatest achievement of FOS during this period was the conduct of the 1952/1953 population census. At the creation of the National Population Commission however, FOS ceased to handle matters relating to population census while all its sample surveys have become more rigorously designed and national in coverage.\n\nAs the functions and responsibilities of FOS became varied and enlarged, it was given a legal backing in 1958 when the Statistics Act was enacted. Apart from amendments affecting population census and penalty concerning data collection and dissemination, this Act remains the main source of responsibility of the FOS and it is still very relevant.\n\nAlso in the 1980s, the office through Decree 42 of 1988 (the civil service review) was organised into 7 departments and 3 units with a Director General. By that Decree, statistical units were supposed to be established in every government agency as a corporate body of that establishment thereby relieving the FOS the task of pooling statisticians at the FOS.\n\nThe National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) came into being with the merger of the Federal Office of Statistics (FOS) and the National Data Bank (NDB).  The creation is part of the  implementation of the Statistical Master Plan (SMP), a programme document of the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN). The document\u2019s preparation was funded by the World Bank in 2003.  The implementation is designed to span five years, 2005-2009.\n\nHitherto, the FOS, which had been the apex data producing agency of Government in Nigeria since 1947, had failed to meet its mandate of producing adequate, accurate and timely data needed for decision making.  Falling into decay in much of the 1990s, the agency\u2019s performance got to its lowest ebb between 2000 and 2003. Among the reasons for this appalling state were the  poor attention from Government, bad management, a bloated and low quality workforce, preponderance of non-professional staff (particularly administrative and accounting personnel), archaic data production and management technologies, and  low morale and productivity of workers.  \n\nAll these manifested in non-production of relevant statistics for planning and evidence-based policy formulation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation, or, at best, the production of data that were untimely and often without any iota of integrity.  This situation necessitated the current process of reforms in the NBS.\n\nThe broad objective of the reforms in the NBS is to implement the SMP and also transform the Bureau along the dictates of the ongoing Federal Government Public Service Reform Programme.  The Agency is involved in the Economic Reform and Governance Programme (ERGP) of the World Bank and the European Union\u2019s (EU\u2019s) EMCAP programme, which are both managed through the Federal Ministry of Finance. The goal of the entire reform programme for NBS is to transform the  Agency into a world class National Statistical Office (NSO), which will be able to produce adequate, high quality and timely data relevant to the demands of users in Government, the universities and research Institutes, private sector organizations and international agencies."

                    "Brief history and other relevant background information": "The Bureau of Statistics was established in 1948 in the Office of Public Information just after the establishment of the new government of Korea. At that time, the Bureau of Statistics had 4 divisions: general affairs, planning, population census and vital statistics. The Bureau of Statistics was transferred to the Ministry of Home Affairs in 1955 and its function was extended from the compilation of population statistics to the compilation of population and economic statistics. \nIn 1961, the Economic Planning Board (EPB) was established to formulate and coordinate the national economic development plan. The EPB was based on four bureaus; two from the Ministry of Construction, and one each from the Ministry of Finance and from the Ministry of Home Affairs (Bureau of Statistics). Thus the Bureau of Statistics was transferred again and put under another ministerial level organization, namely the EPB, and the name of the bureau was changed in 1962 to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBOS), the predecessor of National Statistical Office. From 1961, until the end of the 1980's, the NBOS contributed to the foundation of national economic development plans by producing fundamental statistics and coordinating the national statistical services. \nIn December of 1990, due to the increasing importance of national statistical services with the growth of the economic strength in the 1980's, the NBOS was enlarged and upgraded and the name was changed to the Korea National Statistical Office (hereafter referred to as the KOSTAT), an assistant ministerial level organization. Since the governmental reorganization in 1994, the KOSTAT has been within the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance and Economy which comprises the EPB and the Ministry of Finance. \nIn 1995, according to the rapid change of internal and external situations, the KOSTAT set up a Statistical Information Division and an International Statistics Division. \nIn 1998, the Statistical Survey Bureau was divided into the Economic Statistics Bureau and the Population & Social Statistics Bureau, and the KOSTAT established the Agriculture & Fishery Statistics Division with reception of agricultural and fishery statistics from the Ministry of Agricultural and Forestry and the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries. Additionally, the KOSTAT founded 26 sub-local offices. \nIn 1999, the Statistical Training Center and the Division of Statistical Development in the Bureau of Statistical Planning was abolished. The Division of Statistical Research was renamed as the Division of Statistical Development and transferred to the Bureau of Statistical Planning. The Division of Service Industry Statistics was newly established within the Bureau of Economic Statistics, and the Division of Trade & Price Statistics was renamed as the Division of Price Statistics (4 bureaus, 19 divisions, 12 local statistics offices and 35 sub-local branch offices).\nIn 2000, the KOSTAT was able to appoint a Director-General of Statistical Information Service Bureau on contract and designated Chungnam Statistics Office as the organization in charge of operation.\nIn 2002, the KOSTAT transferred the production of fishery statistics to the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries.\nIn 2004, the Statistical Research & Development Division (15 officials) was newly established within the Statistical Planning Bureau, and the International Statistics Division was renamed the International Statistical Cooperation Division (4 bureaus, 20 divisions, 12 local statistics offices and 35 sub-local branch offices). The Reform & Personnel Division was newly established within the Statistical Planning Bureau and the Planning Division was abolished.\nIn 2005, the Statistical Training Institute was newly set up aiming at training KOSTAT personnel on innovation works and nurturing statistical experts. The Statistical Training Institute consisted of the Training Planning Division and the Training Management Division. The KOSTAT reinforced the functions related to statistical policies, statistical geographic information and supported the development of regional statistics for the purpose of reinforcing national statistical infrastructure and reforming statistical activities. The KOSTAT had 1 training institute (2 divisions), 12 local statistics offices and 35 sub-local branch offices). \nIn 2005, The KOSTAT was also upgraded to the Deputy Ministerial level. The 4th graded local branch offices were renamed the Local Statistics Offices with a view to continuing innovation works of national statistics and reinforcing the functions such as mid-term financial planning, coordination & quality management of national statistics, as well as support of regional statistics. The KOSTAT had 1 office, 4 bureaus, 3 officers, 20 divisions, 3 teams and 1 unit in the headquarters. And the KOSTAT had 1 training institute (2 divisions), 12 local statistics offices and 35 sub-local branch offices.\nIn 2006, The KOSTAT founded the Statistics Research Institute to develop and supply new statistics, and established the Audit & Inspection Officer to reinforce auditing function. And the KOSTAT introduced the high-ranking official pool.\nIn 2008, the production work of agriculture and fishery statistics was transferred to KOSTAT from the Ministry of Agriculture & Forestry and the Ministry of Maritime Affairs & Fisheries according to the revision of \u201cGovernment Organization Act.\u201d\nAs of 2009, KOSTAT is consist of 6 bureaus, 4 offices, 23 divisions and 7 teams in the headquarter while operating the Statistical Training Institute (STI), Statistical Research Institute (SRI) and 5 local offices and 49 local branch offices."

During the process of its realization the basis for creation of national statistical system were established, a system that corresponds to the status of an independent state. \nDuring this period a series of measurements were fulfilled, thus putting the basis for transition to the United Nations\u2019 System of National Accounts (SNA), to elaboration of inter-branch balances, reformation of financial system. New statistical fields were created: external trade, registers and classifiers, enterprise statistics, price and gender statistics.  \nIn 1999 the \u201eReformation Concept of national statistical system in years 1999-2002\u201d was developed and approved by Government.\nFor the purpose of accomplishing the Concept, the process of linkaging the national statistical system to international standards has continued, taking into account country\u2019s peculiarities. For this reason important works were executed regarding the improvement of the system of statistical indicators, their computation methodology, testing and implementation of new data collection and calculation methods based on sample surveys: household budget survey, price survey, annual survey of big and small enterprises, private sector in agriculture, labour force survey, different sociological surveys. \nIn order to facilitate the access to statistical data and a better informatization of internal and external users in different areas, the Web page of the Department of Statistics was launched in year 2002; starting with year 2002 the Statistical Yearbook of Republic of Moldova is also developed on CD Rom. \nIn March 2003 the statistical library was opened, giving the possibility to consult own statistical publications as well as those that come from different statistical bodies from other countries, and from international organizations. \nIn 2004 the population census was conducted according to UN recommendations, the first national census after the proclamation of independence of Republic of Moldova. \nAt the end of year 2004 the new Act \u201con official statistics\u201d (no. 412-XV from December 9, 2004) was approved, thus making the fundamental basis for reformation of national statistics and its connection to international legislative standards respecting statistical principles, such as: impartiality, statistical deontology, relevance, transparency, confidentiality, cost-efficiency principle, coordination at national level and collaboration at international level. \nNowadays, the activity of NBS is carried out in accordance with the medium-term Program (2004-2006) \u201ePriority directions and Action Plan for development of national statistics\u201d.\nOn 2nd May 2006, Moldova became the 63rd member state (subscribed to IMF\u2019 Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS)."

Since 1824 cattle has been included in statistical surveys as well. Since 1834, regular censuses have been carried out every five years. Since 1843, statistical data on external trade, domestic turnover, prices and wages have been compiled.\n     Statistical work was done even before the foundation of the national Statistical Office. There were international congresses of statisticians held in the Hague in 1859, in Berlin in 1863 and Florence in 1867, and they were attended by Serbian statisticians as well.\n     In 1881 the Law on the Organization of Statistics was enacted. In 1882, the Ministry of National Economy assumed responsibility regarding national statistics.\n     The Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia has been a member of the International Statistical Institute since its foundation.\n     The first \"State Statistics\" of Serbia was printed in 1863.\n     The results of population census were published in 1863.\n     The first Statistical Yearbook of the Kingdom of Serbia was published in 1893.\n     In 1894 the \"State Statistics\" was published for the last time.\n     The last Statistical Yearbook of the Kingdom of Serbia was published in 1910. In 1954 a special edition of the Statistical Yearbook of Serbia was re-published.\n     The State Statistics Directorate was founded in 1919 in the scope of the Ministry of Social Policy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, but a special Statistical Office of Serbia was opened only in 1945.\n     The Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia was founded in 1945. \n"

                    "Brief history and other relevant background information": "July 12, 1859 - The ruler Alexandru Ioan Cuza signed The Ordinance on the setting up on Central Administrative Statistics Office, marking the birth certificate of official statistics in Romania. This moment is also related to the names of two famous Romanian economists of the XIX-th century, Dionisie Pop Martian and Ion Ionescu de la Brad.\n\nIn the long run, official statistics, one of the first public institutions created in Romania after the Union as well as one of oldest statistical offices in Europe has faced evolutions and reorganizations, successively changing its name, always observing the principles of truth and probity of its approach, keeping its status of main instrument of knowledge and evaluation of the country reality, providing, through statistical data and information, the necessary background to the authorities, to economic units, to the whole society, to build up and put into practice some realistic programs of governing, of economic and social development.\n\n\nI. Start and confirmation (1859-1877)\n\nSince the beginning, without having the necessary material resources, sufficient and specialized staff, the statistical institution ventured and succeeded to end far-reaching actions, gaining fame and prestige. The following were achieved:\n\no Population Census (1859-1860) \n\no Industrial Establishment Census (1863), the first national survey of an European Country \n\no \"Statistical and Economic Annals (1860)\" \n\no Romania was among the most active participants in international statistical congresses in London, Berlin, Florence and Hague \n\nII. Contributions to economic and social consolidation of Romania after conquering the state independence (1877-1914).\n\nCarrying on the steps of the pioneer period, official statistics is one of the main pillars of the Romanian state in the period of its consolidation, through a substantial contribution of statistical information necessary to take accurate decisions for the country development. The following were achieved:\n\no Population Census of 1899 and 1912 \n\no Publication System was enriched with the following series:\n\nRomanian Statistical Bulletin (1892)\nDemographic Review (1892)\nStatistical Yearbook of Romania (1909) \n\no Higher statistical education was created, through the Academy of High Commercial and Social Studies (1913) \n\nIII. Romanian statistical school in vanguard of international statistics (1918-1945)\n\nBetween the two world wars, Romanian official statistics imposes itself, through its great personalities, the status of a prestige school at international level. It is the period when the institution takes advantage from the creative activity of famous personalities: Dimitrie Gusti, Octav Onicescu, Grigore Moisil, Gheorghe Mihoc, Sabin Manuila, Anton Golopentia etc.\n\nReference points:\n\no Romanian Agriculture Atlas (1929) \n\no General Population Census of Romania (1930) \n\no General Census of Romania (1941), in which the main place was held by the inventory of industrial enterprises \n\no Agriculture Census (1941), the first systematic paper of this type carried out in our country \n\no Extension of selective samples for almost all fields of national economy \n\no Setting up the Statistical School (1930) which became Statistical Institute of Bucharest University (1941) \n\nIV. Keeping the identity and professional probity (1946-1989)\n\nThe years after the second world war, a period full of obstacles and difficulties, of all kinds of pressure, are however characterized by the efforts made by a new generation of statisticians - most of them were ex-collaborators and disciples of previous period masters - to assure the continuity of statistical data and series and to keep at great extent the credibility of Romanian official statistics, in spite of totalitarian regime, of convenient and make up presentation of some statistical information. Among the efforts made to keep the identity of statistical science and of professional probity of its civil servants, it is well known the contribution of Mihail Levente and Mircea Biji, of other remarkable specialists for the following:\n\no Carrying out very complex statistical papers\n\nPopulation and Housing Census (1966 and 1977) \nThe first balance of economic branches connection \n\no Passing to data electronic processing \n\no Beginning the collaboration with UN Statistical Direction\n\nV. For a functional market economy, serving the state of right and democratic values of Romanian society\n\nThe new history of statistics is related to the end of 1989. After December 1989, Romanian statistics regained the virtues of a modern statistics, complying with the international norms and standards, aiming at obtaining comparable statistical data. The preponderantly exhaustive surveys carried out during the years previous to the Revolution were mostly replaced with sample surveys, which imply a special scientific rigor on the information producer side, wider specific knowledge on the statistician side and, at the same time, a statistical culture of information user and provider, in view to perceive their values and to use them in their undertakings.\nSince that moment, a lot of difficulties and a lot of challenges were faced.\nIf one would like to make an inventory of various milestones of statistical starting with 1990, this should include the following:\n\uf0d8\t1992: Government Ordinance on official statistics functioning (subsequently approved by Law in 1994);\n\uf0d8\t1992: Common Declaration between Eurostat and 7 countries in transition (among which, Romania);\n\uf0d8\t1994: bilateral Common Declaration between Eurostat & INS/Romania;\n\uf0d8\t1996: the reply to the first questionnaire from the to Ministry of the Europe Integration (a detailed self assessment of the Romanian statistics);\n\uf0d8\t1998 & 1999: two screening exercises took place one multicountry and one bilateral with the European Commission experts;\n\uf0d8\t2000: chapter 12 of  negotiation on statistics in the acquis communautaire, meaning that Romania complied with EU norms and standards, without requesting any derogations or transition periods;\n\uf0d8\tyears of Phare Programs (National & Multicountry) assisting the Romanian statistics development resulted in progresses towards the sustainability of the system;\n\uf0d8\tyears of being observers in the working parties, task forces, seminars, conferences in Eurostat, through which we learnt a lot not only from Eurostat, but also from our colleagues from EU Member States.\nNowadays, the Romanian statistics is integrated in the decision making process and deeply involved at the international and European level. As an arch over time and over cooperation matters dealt by INS/Romania, since 2006 the institute turns to give technical assistance to other countries needing this, such as: Turkey, Georgia, Armenia, Ukraine."

Russian statistical system was re-established in 1921 when the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was created. Until 1990, the statistical work of the statistical service of Russia was carried out under the direct guidance of the USSR Central Statistics Board. Since 1990, the State Committee on Statistics has been an independent government agency under the supervision of the Government, bearing full responsibility for the organization of statistical work in the country.

Since then, censuses have been taken regularly at ten-year intervals. The Census Ordinance of 1880 constituted the first statistical legislation for Singapore.\n\nA legal framework for the collection, preparation and publication of official statistics was put in place only in 1921 with the enactment of the Statistics Ordinance. The Statistics Ordinance provided for the establishment of a Statistical Bureau. The Bureau has developed and grown to become the Singapore Department of Statistics today.\n\nThe Singapore Department of Statistics is the national statistical office  responsible for official statistics on the Singapore economy and population. Before Singapore achieved self-government in 1959, the Department compiled almost all the statistical series. The focus was on external trade, shipping and cargo statistics and basic demographic data. The statistical activities expanded rapidly in the 1960s to cover manufacturing, and service statistics.\n\nSince 1973, a decentralised statistical system has been adopted. Official statistics are collected and compiled by the Singapore Department of Statistics as well as Research and Statistics Units (RSUs) in various government ministries and statutory boards. The RSUs specialise in statistics on key areas under the purview of their parent organisations."

On the base of this Act, legal subjectivity of regional offices (with seat in Bratislava, Trnava, Nitra, Tren\u010d\u00edn, \u017dilina, Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica, Ko\u0161ice and in Pre\u0161ov, which took part in fulfilling the tasks of the SO SR in the fields by relevant specialization for the whole territory of the Slovak Republic in 1996 - 2001) was cancelled from 1 January 2002 and regional offices became directly a part of the Office as its internal organizational units. The Act created a space for strengthening stability and independence of the Office by enacting appointment and recalling of the President of the Office by the President of the SR on a proposal of the Slovak Government with the term of office for five years (with a possibility to re-appoint the same person only for two consequent terms of office).\n\nThe legislative intent of the act on 2011 population and housing census has laid the foundation for creation of wide source of information necessary for prognosis of the trends in demography and for decision-making in social policy of the state. Great progress was made in dissemination and provision of information by putting the new internet portal into operation and by on-line database of regional statistics. The Office, as an integral part of the European Statistical System, has actively participated on initiatives towards the system development, creation of statistical legislation, introduction of new statistical procedures and methods, and increase of comparability and quality of statistical data. The development of the management quality system has continued, as well as implementation of the Code of Practice into all fields. The team of the experts of the European Statistical System has stated, after the examination of implementation, that the SOSR is the professional and well performing institution.\n"
