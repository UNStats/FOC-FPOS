The CSO also undertook some limited surveys on health and education as well as some sample surveys within Kabul; and was also involved in the preparation of various National Plans drawn up by the Ministry of Planning. The work of the CSO staff in the provincial offices was to collect data from the various Ministry provincial offices as well as the Provincial Government. These collections covered all economic and social data, particularly in areas such as customs data, agriculture, transport and industry.\n\nThe CSO was established in 1973; prior to that point in time there was a small Statistics Department in the Ministry of Interior.

Since the early seventies, the Statistics Unit of the Government of Anguilla produced statistics about residential society and conducted censuses in 1974, 1984 and 1992. The first Statistical Abstract containing administrative sources' data for the period 1960 - 82 was published in 1984.  Along with further development of the statistical programs, priority was given to the development of economic statistics. After the establishment of the Consumer Price Index, a number of statistical surveys were conducted in 1985; moreover, a survey of business establishments was carried out to produce the National Accounts.\n\nIn 1998-1999, two household sample surveys were conducted, which provided valuable information on household incomes / expenditures and labor force. The next household and population census was conducted in 2001, which provided broad database of Anguillian society, including household register necessary for household surveys sampling. Over the 4-year period since November 2000, the status of the Statistics Unit has been upgraded to that of a department with its own budget and a Chief Statistician."

                    "Organizational structure and finance": "The statistical services of Federal, provincial and municipal agencies are all integrated into and coordinated by the National Statistical System. In each of the 23 Argentine provinces, as well as in the Federal Capital (the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires) there operates a provincial Statistical Office (DPE, Direcci\u00f3n Provincial de Estad\u00edstica), under the control of the respective provincial government. Each provincial Statistical Office coordinates statistical activities in its respective province and takes active part in collecting, entering and processing information at that level. In turn, the INDEC and other Federal agencies consolidate the data furnished by the provinces in order to obtain integrated and consistent information from the entire nation. The production of statistical information by the INDEC results from various data collection procedures (censuses, surveys, administrative and other government records) which make it possible to elaborate a number of indicators describing different fields of social and economic interest.\n\nThrough the various activities of its Dissemination/Communications Division (Direcci\u00f3n de Difusi\u00f3n) the INDEC is in permanent contact with users from both the public and the private sectors, in Argentina as well as abroad. The launching of its Statistical Services Center (CES, Centro Estad\u00edstico de Servicios) brought about an across-the-board reappraisal of the Institute's relations to the different groups of information users. Thus the INDEC is now committed to make full use of all technologically available communication channels in order to achieve effective contact with the general public.\n\nThe Institute's operational structure is organized into three basic areas:\no\tstatistical production,\no\tdissemination,\no\tsupport activities to facilitate statistical production and dissemination.\n\nThe statistical production departments survey and process data required by the general public and by government policy-making decisions. Each specialized sector of the Institute defines the goals and scope of its research programs, develops the appropriate methodological procedures and defines the operative concepts that are to be measured in the INDEC's censuses and surveys.\n\nThe department of publications and statistics dissemination (Direcci\u00f3n de Difusi\u00f3n) makes the results available to the community at large in order to satisfy the general public's information needs as well as those of special users. In due turn, the analysis and interpretation by different types of users in their own decision-making process stimulate changes in statistical approaches and spur new demands for information to be provided by the INDEC.\n\nLastly, the technical support sector provides adequate facilities, backing and maintenance to the other two areas enabling them to carry out their statistical endeavors and to disseminate their results. Thus the INDEC's support area clears out budget snags and solves logistic, computer and technological problems; it also trains human resources and effectively paves the way for the obtention and dissemination of public statistics.",
                    "Multi-annual or annual work program": "The INDEC is also responsible for the coordination of the National Statistical System (SEN, Sistema Estad\u00edstico Nacional), under the principle of procedural, methodological and standards' centralization coupled with operative decentralization. This means that the INDEC is ultimately responsible for the production of public statistics under appropriate quality and methodological standards, to ensure reliability and comparability of data obtained from many different sources and jurisdictions.",
                    "Main duties": "With the purpose of maintaining continuous communication with the international community of public statistics, the INDEC cooperates on a permanent basis with both government and non-government international organizations, as well as with other countries' national statistical agencies. Thus the participation of National Statistical System officials in training activities abroad is consistently promoted. At the same time, the Institute also promotes the active cooperation of foreign public statistical experts in the INDEC's activities as well as the exchange of technical missions with other countries and agencies.\n\nThroughout the world, the impact of public statistics on policy-making decisions in economic, demographic, social and environmental matters makes it necessary to ensure the quality and reliability of statistical data. Because of this need, the United Nations Statistical Commission adopted the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics drawn up in 1992 by the Economic Commission for Europe in view of promoting their acceptance and implementation in other regions. The INDEC endorses these recommendations and carries out its activities in accordance to the following guidelines:\n\n1. Public statistics are an essential element in a free democratic society's information system. They provide economic, demographic, social and environmental data to the government, to the economic actors and to the general public. For these purposes, official statistical agencies should impartially compile and disseminate public statistics of proven practical usefulness enabling the citizenry to assert its rights to adequate public information.\n\n2. In order to preserve the public trust in official statistics, the agencies responsible for public statistics should base their decisions solely on strictly professional considerations, including adequate scientific criteria and professional ethical standards, whenever methods and procedures for the collection, processing, storage and presentation of statistical data are involved.\n\n3. In order to enable a correct interpretation of data, statistical agencies should present their information in accordance to scientific standards concerning sources, methods and procedures.\n\n4. Public statistical agencies have the right criticize erroneous interpretations and the improper use of official statistics.\n\n5. Data for statistical purposes may be obtained from a variety of sources, including statistical surveys/censuses and administrative records. Statistical agencies should select their sources taking into consideration quality, timeliness, cost, and burden on the informant population.\n\n6. Data gathered by public statistical agencies for compilation purposes, involving either individuals or firms, should be handled in strictly confidential terms and used exclusively for statistical purposes.\n\n7. The general public should be clearly informed about the public laws, regulations and provisions governing the operation of statistical systems.\n\n8. Coordination among official statistical agencies throughout the nation is indispensable to warrant consistency and efficiency in the system of public statistics.\n\n9. The use of international concepts, classifications and methods by each country's official statistical agencies promotes consistency and efficiency in the respective national system of statistics.\n\n10. In every country, bilateral and multilateral cooperation in statistical matters contributes to the improvement of the respective national statistical systems."

                    "Brief history and other relevant background information": "Towards the end of the 19th century Argentina underwent unprecedented demographic and economic changes whose appraisal and measurement were of vital interest to the ruling classes that were forging ahead with the so-called National Organization process. Statistical research aimed at increasing knowledge about the population growth and the consequences of immigration, as well as obtaining information about the conditions of economic production. Such knowledge was essential to the diagnosis and design of government policies. Thus, in 1869 the first National Population Census was carried out throughout the entire Argentine territory.\n\nIn 1929, as a consequence of developments in the country's social and productive structure, derived in turn from the new international economic conditions as well as from the effects of successive waves of European immigration on Argentina's population patterns, particularly in the aftermath of both World Wars, there arose new demands for further national statistical researches.\n\nA list of the Argentine government agencies in charge of the production of public statistics in the last hundred years follows, with an indication of its insertion in the government structure.\n\n1894: Direcci\u00f3n General de Estad\u00edstica (General Direction of Statistics), an agency of the Ministerio de Hacienda (Ministry of Public Finances).\n\n1944: Consejo Nacional de Estad\u00edstica y Censos (National Council of Statistics and Censuses), an agency of the Consejo de Defensa Nacional, Ministerio del Interior (Council of National Defense in the Ministry of Interior), and of the Secretar\u00eda T\u00e9cnica de la Presidencia de la Naci\u00f3n (Technical Secretariat of the Argentine Presidency).\n\n1950: Direcci\u00f3n General del Sistema Estad\u00edstico Nacional (General Direction of the National Statistical System), an agency of the Direcci\u00f3n Nacional de Servicios T\u00e9cnicos del Estado, Ministerio de Asuntos T\u00e9cnicos (National Direction of the Technical Services of the State, in the Ministry of Technical Affairs).\n\n1952: Direcci\u00f3n Nacional de Servicio Estad\u00edstico (National Direction of Statistical Service), an agency of both the Ministry of Technical Affairs and the Ministry of Public Finances.\n\n1956: Direcci\u00f3n Nacional de Estad\u00edstica y Censos (National Direction of Statistics and Censuses), an agency of the Ministerio de Econom\u00eda (Ministry of Economy).\n\n1968: The National Institute of Statistics and Censuses (INDEC) is created. From its inception, it was successively subordinated to various agencies and departments of the Executive branch, preserving in all cases its independence regarding the production of public statistics. At present it is an agency of the Secretar\u00eda de Programaci\u00f3n Econ\u00f3mica y Regional, Ministerio de Econom\u00eda y Obras y Servicios P\u00fablicos de la Naci\u00f3n (Secretariat of Economic and Regional Planning in the National Ministry of Economy and Public Works and Services).\n\nThe INDEC as such started to operate in 1968 under the provisions of its founding act, National Law No. 17622. This law not only created the Institute but also specified its two main operational purposes and objectives:\n\n- To direct and supervise all public statistics.\n\n- To organize and direct the National Statistical System (SEN).\n\nThe INDEC coordinates the SEN operations under the principle of procedural, methodological and standards' centralization coupled with operative decentralization. It draws up the Annual Program of Statistics and Censuses and develops the methods and standards that will ensure the comparability of statistical information originated in different sources.\n\nBesides governing all SEN operations, the aforementioned national law sets forth the obligation for all persons in the Argentine territory to provide data and information of statistical interest as may be required by agencies included in the SEN, under the assurance that the secrecy of such individual data will be duly preserved. In accordance to the provisions of its governing law, the INDEC publishes the results of all its surveys and censuses in aggregate compilations, so as to preserve individual or specific business information from undue publicity or exploitation and to prevent the identification of any individual personal or business source.\n\nThe consolidation of democracy after 1983 reinforced the citizens' role in demanding accountability from public officials.\n\n- The deregulation of the national economy and the integration of Argentina into the global markets, as well as the transformation of the country's production structure, required an increased availability of timely statistical data in the decision making process. In 1991 a thorough \"reform of the State\" and deregulation of the economy were implemented, both of which increased the need for efficient indicators to describe the results of government policies.\n\n- In that context, the previous information gaps about education, health, housing and social services' coverage, as well as the impact of technolog ical and economic changes on employment and on the population's consumption patterns, reinforced the need for updated and reliable public statistics.\n\n- These developments caused the INDEC to diversify its production and to accelerate the publication of its results, as well as ensuring its widespread dissemination. For these purposes, the Institute's work and research procedures were updated, the operations of the SEN (National Statistical System) were redesigned, and the production of provincial, regional and municipal statistics was intensified, always ensuring their comparability and their dissemination after publication, as well as welcoming the demands and needs of new users.\n\nSocial and economic developments give rise to demands of statistical information that trigger the INDEC's statistical production cycle. The cycle starts with the definition of a theoretical frame for the study of the selected research object. Specific indicators are designed to measure the phenomenon in question and relevant data collection activities are carried out in the community under study. Validation procedures established by the INDEC are performed, and the resulting data are processed to obtain statistical information that will be disseminated among public officials, interested researchers throughout the world, as well as the population at large. When this information is analyzed and interpreted, different users will base on it their decision making process, and as a consequence of such interactions new demands for statistical information will arise.\n\nThus the INDEC produces relevant data which provide social and economic agents with an information infrastructure extremely useful for interpreting the real world. The main trait of this type of information is the rigorous scientific methodology used in its production and applied to research procedures, data collection and processing, as well as to data quality control safeguards. In addition, the INDEC offers technical assistance to other agencies concerning methodological design, organization, implementation and data processing of statistical surveys.\n\nThese attributes have earned the INDEC widespread recognition as a highly qualified technical agency, independent from political influences, whose activity is oriented to provide timely answers to current specific demands for statistical information. The Institute generates two basic types of information:\n\n-social, demographic and economic information, obtained from censuses, surveys and public registries/records;\n\n-indexes and short-term indicators.\n\nUpon recommendation of international organizations, in order to facilitate international comparability of results, national censuses are carried out periodically to survey the basic characteristics of the country's population and housing conditions, agricultural and other economic activities. The various units surveyed during national and provincial censuses provide the sample framework for surveys carried out in intercensual periods to measure the evolution of indicators among the population under study.\n\nThese surveys are used to extend the results obtained from a sample to the total reference population. Such procedures are applied in the Encuesta Permanente de Hogares (National Household Survey), the Encuesta Nacional de Gastos de los Hogares (National Household Expenditures Survey), the Encuesta Industrial Mensual/Anual (Monthly Industrial Survey and Yearly Industrial Survey), the Encuesta Nacional Agropecuaria (ENA, National Agricultural Survey), et cetera.\n\nOther indexes and indicators are derived from primary or secondary data-they make possible an accurate and synthetic followup of developments in various fields of activity. Some such indicators are the \u00cdndice de Precios al Consumidor (IPC, Consumer Price Index), the \u00cdndice del Costo de la Construcci\u00f3n (ICC, Construction Cost Index), the Sistema de \u00cdndices de Precios Mayoristas (System of Wholesale Prices Indexes) and the Intercambio Comercial Argentino (Argentine Foreign Trade) indicators. The Institute also carries out special studies (Estudios Especiales) used in decision-making diagnoses, such as research modules on specific subject matter, standardization of classifications and nomenclatures, as well as methodological investigation.\n\nThrough the various activities of its Dissemination/Communications Division (Direcci\u00f3n de Difusi\u00f3n) the INDEC is in permanent contact with users from both the public and the private sectors, in Argentina as well as abroad. The launching of its Statistical Services Center (CES, Centro Estad\u00edstico de Servicios) brought about an across-the-board reappraisal of the Institute's relations to the different groups of information users. Thus the INDEC is now committed to make full use of all technologically available communication channels in order to achieve effective contact with the general public.\n\nThe Institute's operational structure is organized into three basic areas:\no\tstatistical production,\no\tdissemination,\no\tsupport activities to facilitate statistical production and dissemination.\n\nThe statistical production departments survey and process data required by the general public and by government policy-making decisions. Each specialized sector of the Institute defines the goals and scope of its research programs, develops the appropriate methodological procedures and defines the operative concepts that are to be measured in the INDEC's censuses and surveys.\n\nThe department of publications and statistics dissemination (Direcci\u00f3n de Difusi\u00f3n) makes the results available to the community at large in order to satisfy the general public's information needs as well as those of special users.

Thus the INDEC's support area clears out budget snags and solves logistic, computer and technological problems; it also trains human resources and effectively paves the way for the obtention and dissemination of public statistics.\n\nIn recent years the use of statistical information in decision making has increased considerably. The immediate consequence of this growth for the agencies producing public statistics has been a marked increase in user demand for objectivity, disaggregation and timeliness, both in the production and dissemination of information."

The meetings were to discuss statistical issues and agree on measures to aid in the consistency of statistics across the states and it was through these meetings that some of the Statists were beginning to see the advantages in the prospect of a national statistical authority that might lend its weight to the decisions of the conferences.\n\nIn 1905 the Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics (CBCS) was established according with the Census and Statistics Act 1905.\n\nIn 1924 the Tasmanian Statistical Office was transferred to the CBCS, with the merger of the all other SSO's accomplished in the late 1950s.\n\nIn 1974 an Australian Government review recommended the establishment of a central statistical authority with full statutory powers that was administratively independent of any department and thereby perceived to be policy neutral.  The Australian Statistician was to be a statutory appointee vested with the powers of a head of department under the Public Service Act 1975.  This review led to the development of the Australian Bureau of Statistics Act 1975. Under this Act the Australian Bureau of Statistics was established with the role of the central statistical authority for the Australian Government and, by arrangements, for the governments of the states and territories."

The Act requires the ABS to publish and disseminate compilations and analyses of statistical information and to maintain the confidentiality of information collected under the Act. \n\nSection 13 of the CSA provides for the Minister to make determinations providing for the disclosure, with the approval in writing of the Australian Statistician, of information included in a specified class of information furnished in pursuance of that Act. The Statistics Determination is such a determination and provides for the release of a very restricted range of information under special circumstances.\n\nSection 9 of the CSA provides for the Australian Statistician to collect such statistical information in relation to matters prescribed as he or she considers appropriate.

                    "Brief history and other relevant background information": "The arrangement of statistics in Azerbaijan commenced with the operation of the statistical committees within the Shamakhy (from 1846-till 1859), Baku (1859) and Ganja (1967) provinces. The annual reports of the provinces combining 20-27 statistical tables issued from the said period till 1917 incorporated the statistical materials on the of the population, number of cattle, workers, fairs, factories and plants, the circulation of plants and products and fairs, the commercial prices of major goods, the number of militants and other information. During 23 months of the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan (1918-1920) the government made attempts to establish a single body regulating the statistical issues on the territory of the country. Though the aim was not achieved, definite structures related to statistics were created within different Ministries. These structures started operating as the Statistical department within the Ministry of State Property and Agriculture from November 15, 1918 and as the Statistical Bureau with the Lands Fund of the Agricultural Ministry from July of 1919. \n\nThe establishment of the local statistical bodies started in Azerbaijan in 1924 and later the statistical bodies were created in all the regions of the country. The new regulation on the Central Statistical Department of the Azerbaijan SSR was adopted by the People\u2019s Commissars Council of the Azerbaijan SSR and Central Executive Committee of Azerbaijan on September 28, 1928. The central statistical department separated from the State Planning Commission in August of 1948 and joined the Central Statistical Committee under the USSR Council of Ministers in August of 1948. This fact was of great importance for the improvement of the activity of statistical bodies.

There was an overwhelming need for data about the people and the economy of The Bahamas. The newly created statistical unit was charged with a five-fold responsibility: \n\n-  Collect, compile, analyze, abstract and publish statistical information relating to the commercial, social, industrial, agricultural, financial, economic and general activities and conditions of the inhabitants of the Bahamas;\n\n-  Collaborate with all other departments of government in the collection, compilation and publication of statistical records of administration;\n\n-  Conduct general purpose surveys, including any census of population in The Bahamas;\n\n-  Advise on all matters of policy relating to statistics; and\n\n-  Generally organize a co-ordinated scheme of social and economic statistics pertaining to the Commonwealth of The Bahamas.\n\nIn order to produce official statistics, the DOS undertakes a large number of separate collections, ranging from decennial censuses of population to regular household surveys on specific social or economic issues and from periodic censuses to regular surveys of industry to provide current economic indicators. The DOS devotes considerable effort to producing statistics as a byproduct of administrative systems, and continually assesses user requirements and the capacity of providers to furnish additional data in an effort to update its system."

Oswald (UN Advisor) formed the nucleus of the Department of Statistics. They began operations in rented space above the Spotless Laundry in Palmdale. T heir first official task involved the production of External Trade Statistics. They were assisted by a number of customs officers who were on loan to the Department from the Customs Department.\n\nThe neophyte unit plunged into the statistical world with eagerness and passion and by the end of the first year's activities, had taken over the responsibility for external trade statistics and the preparation of the retail price index.\n\nBy the end of 1969, the services of a Director in the person of Mr. J. Egbert Tertullien (formerly of Statistics Canada) had been acquired. The staff now boasted two statistical officers, two statistical assistants and some supporting clerical staff. They now occupied a suite of offices in Nassau Court in what was once The Government High School. The Department was ready to take on big tasks.\n\nFrom these humble beginnings, a modern state-of-the art, fully staffed department, operating from two separate locations has emerged."

                    "Brief history and other relevant background information": "Bangladesh has a centralized official statistical system named the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS). At independence in December 1971, Bangladesh owned a weak and disintegrated official statistical system. Agencies producing statistics were many and all these agencies were working independent of one another and pursuing statistical programs that had limited scopes and objectives. Data generated by them were inadequate and in many areas incomplete and as such, could not provide satisfactory basis for formulation of plans and framing policies of the new nation. Need for an integrated national official statistical system therefore, was felt extremely urgent after independence and paid due attention to by government.\n\nAccording in August 1974, the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) was created by the government by merging four relatively larger statistical agencies of the provincial and central governments, namely, the Bureau of Statistics, the Bureau of Agriculture Statistics, the Agriculture Census Commission and the Population Census Commission.\n\nA Director General was also appointed by the government to head of the BBS and a follow-up plan for reorganizing the Bureau into an efficient centralized national institution in the field of official statistics was resolved to be taken up for implementation.\n\nAbout a year later in July 1975, the Statistics Division was created and placed under the Ministry of Planning in order to control the BBS at Ministry level, provide it policy guidance and also co-ordinate, develop and carry out all programs of training in official statistics. The Statistics Division was headed by a Secretary who was also the Directory General of Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics.\n\nIn 2002, the Statistics Division merged with Planning Commission and BBS is now controlled by Ministry of Planning and office headed by Director General.\n\nBangladesh Bureau of Statistics is responsible for providing technical and administrative guidance to the Bureau in matters of all official statistics programmes and the implementation agency of all programmes of official statistics of Bangladesh. Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) is the only national Statistical Institution responsible for collecting, compiling and disseminating statistical data of all the sectors of the Bangladesh economy to meet and provide the data-needs of the users for the national planning and formulating policies by the government. The role of the BBS is providing the necessary statistics for preparing the various national plans and policies for the overall development of the country is very significant.\n\nBangladesh Bureau of Statistics has a decentralized network for implementation its activities with its head office in Dhaka. In 2006, there were 23 regional statistical offices and 489 Upazilla/Thana offices located in the 23 greater districts in Bangladesh.\n\n"

Publication of statistical results is decided by the I.N.S. after consultation with the High Council of Statistics. In special cases, authorisation is requested from the Minister.\n\nThe national administrations, the various regional and communal executive organs, the provincial and municipal administrations as well as their subsidiary organs of public interest have to notify the I.N.S.  of any decision to treat statistically the data in their possession. One copy of each of their statistical publications has to be deposited with the I.N.S.

In 1841, a Central Commission of Statistics was formed, since 1946 called High Council of Statistics. In 1932, the name of the statistical bureau was changed into Central Office of Statistics. Further centralisation was achieved after 1939. The office was transferred to the Ministry of Economic Affairs in 1940, and its name changed again in 1946 into National Institute of Statistics (Institut National de Statistique/Nationaal Instituut voor de Statistiek).\n\nSince 1977, the Institute opened 5 bureaux in different parts of the country, to bring statistics closer to the users. Each bureau has its own documentation and information service.\n\nIn 1994 the Government of Belgium carried out a reform of the statistical and economic projections system by creating the National Accounts Institute (Institut des Comptes Nationaux - I.C.N).  The Institute was placed under the authority of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and given the task of setting up the national accounts, and working on statistics of foreign trade (which until that moment was under the authority of the National Institute of Statistics - NIS) and economic projections. The I.C.N. is managed jointly by the National Bank, National Institute of Statistics and the Planning Bureau.  The I.N.S. continued to supply the data bases necessary for the work of the I.C.N., and preserves its co-ordinating role at the level of the official statistics, given by the legislation.\n\nThis reform was carried out with a view of improving the economic statistics and allowing the I.N.S.  to free resources in order to accomplish an internal restructuring which became necessary."

                    "Brief history and other relevant background information": "Bhutan embarked on the path to modernization and development by initiating the first socio-economic development plan in 1961. A decade later in 1971, His Majesty, the Late King Jigme Dorji Wangchuck constituted the Planning Commission, an independent body, with the then Crown Prince, HRH Jigme Singye Wangchuck as the Chairman and HRH Ashi Dechen Wangmo Wangchuck as the Vice-Chairperson. The 13 member Commission constituted of the Representatives of His Majesty, Speaker of the National Assembly, Ministers of the Government, Chairman and Representatives of the Royal Advisory Council, Secretary of the Ministry of Development (member secretary) and the Government of India Advisers in the Ministries of Development and Finance as Observers.\n\nThe broad functions of the Planning Commission and its Secretariat were to formulate overall development strategies and coordinate sectoral activities, policies and programmes, and formulate Five-Year Plans and programmes. The Commission was also responsible for aid management, co-ordinating inter-ministerial development programmes, and monitoring and evaluating programmes at the macro-level. It was also the role of the Commission to ensure the timely implementation of the Plans according to specified objectives and priorities. However, in 1993 the role of aid management was transferred to the Ministry of Finance. Furthermore, in the same year the role of Dzongkhag Development Coordination was transferred from the Ministry of Home Affairs to the Planning Commission. \n\nHis Majesty, King Jigme Singye Wangchuck was the Chairman of the Planning Commission from 1971 to 1991. In 1991, His Majesty the King relinquished the Chairmanship of the Planning Commission to ensure greater decentralization in the decision-making process. The Minister of the Planning Commission Secretariat, Lyonpo Chenkyab Dorji was appointed as the new Chairman. The reconstituted Planning Commission had 15 members consisting of all the Representatives of His Majesty the King, the Chairman of the Royal Advisory Council and all ministers, deputy ministers, senior secretaries of the Government and the Chief Operations Officer of the armed forces.\n\nPolicy and Planning Divisions (PPDs) were established in the various ministries in 1991 after detailed discussions at various levels of the Government. The PPDs were set up to act as a direct professional link between the line agencies and the Planning Commission to improve the quality and efficiency of the planning process. A Technical Committee to assist and advise the Planning Commission on issues of technical and professional expertise was also established in 1991. It had 21 members comprising of heads of divisions and other technical personnel from various ministries and departments. The Committee was chaired by the members on a rotational basis and met as and when necessary.\n\nWith the dissolution of the Lhengyel Shungtshog by Royal Decree in 1998, the Planning Commission was reconstituted. The Chairman of the Council of Ministers (all elected ministers) appointed Lyonpo Yeshey Zimba, Finance Minister as the new Chairman of the Planning Commission on 10th August 1998. The Planning Commission was reconstituted with 17 members as per Government Order No.COM/02/42 issued on 27th January 1999. The members were appointed for a period of three years after which fifty percent of the membership would be changed and fifty percent would remain to retain continuity. The members were appointed based on their professional and individual capacities. The Technical Committee was dissolved in 1999, after the reconstitution of the Planning Commission."

With the declaration of the Republic, the government felt it necessary to expand the scope of action of this department, mainly after the implementation of the civil register of births, marriages and deaths.\n\nAs time went by, the organization in charge of statistics in Brazil underwent several changes in its name and activities until 1934, when the General Department of Statistics was extinct and its activities were shared among suitable ministries.\n\nThe necessity of having an organization to conduct and control statistical surveys, so as to unify the works of specialized services existing in the country, favored the creation, in 1934, of the national Institute of Statistics \u2013 INE, which started its activities on May 29, 1936. In the following year, the Brazilian Council of Geography was created and annexed to INE, which then became the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics.\n\nIBGE has kept this mission for 71 years: it identifies and analyzes the territory, counts the population, shows how the economy has evolved through the work of people and reveals how they live."

                    "Brief history and other relevant background information": "Histoire de la statistique du Burkina Faso \n \nLe syst\u00e8me statistique national du Burkina Faso doit \u00eatre plac\u00e9 dans le cadre du d\u00e9veloppement \u00e9conomique, social et politique du pays. \n\nS\u2019il est ind\u00e9niable qu\u2019on ne peut concevoir un peuple organis\u00e9 sans statistiques, il convient  tout de m\u00eame de reconna\u00eetre que la tentative de cr\u00e9er un syst\u00e8me statistique  plus ou moins coh\u00e9rent remonte \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e8re coloniale. C\u2019est ainsi que pour faire face surtout aux besoins de l\u2019administration coloniale que sont les lev\u00e9es d\u2019imp\u00f4ts, les travaux forc\u00e9s, les recrutements militaires et scolaires, fut  mis en place un syst\u00e8me de recensements administratifs, puis des services d\u2019\u00e9tat civil. \n\nPlus tard avec les aubes des ind\u00e9pendances, naquirent d\u2019autres besoins en donn\u00e9es plus \u00e9labor\u00e9es, qui prirent bient\u00f4t le pas sur les recrutements militaires et les lev\u00e9es d\u2019imp\u00f4ts. C\u2019est ainsi qu\u2019en 1958 le Bureau Statistique vit le jour  pour devenir en f\u00e9vrier 1963 le Service National de la Statistique et des Etudes Economiques (SNSEE). En mars 1966 le  Service National de la Statistique et des Etudes Economiques se mua \u00e0 son tour en Direction de la Statistique et de la M\u00e9canographie, qui entrera dans la m\u00e9moire collective des Volta\u00efques d\u2019alors, comme \u00e9tant le service charg\u00e9 du traitement de la solde des fonctionnaires. \n\nEn 1974, suite  au transfert du traitement de la solde au Centre National de Traitement de l\u2019Information (CENATRIN), une organisation nouvelle s\u2019imposa. C\u2019est ainsi que la Direction de la Statistique  et de la M\u00e9canographie amput\u00e9e de certaines pr\u00e9rogatives et de la m\u00e9canographie  se m\u00e9tamorphose en Institut National de la Statistique  et de la D\u00e9mographie (INSD), en tant que direction centrale de l\u2019administration publique. Plus tard, la recherche d\u2019une plus grande efficacit\u00e9 dans la collecte, le traitement, l\u2019analyse la publication et la diffusion de l\u2019information statistique a conduit les autorit\u00e9s de notre pays a \u00e9riger l\u2019Institut National de la Statistique et de la D\u00e9mographie, par le D\u00e9cret N\u00b02000-508/PRES/PM/MEF du 27 Octobre 2000, en Etablissement Public de l\u2019Etat \u00e0 caract\u00e8re Administratif (EPA).   \n\nQuel que soit son statut, l\u2019INSD est et demeure l\u2019organe officiel de collecte, de traitement  et de diffusion de l\u2019information statistique au niveau national.  \n\nCependant, tout au long de ce processus  et bien souvent en l\u2019accompagnant, on a assist\u00e9 \u00e0 la naissance  et au d\u00e9veloppement avec plus ou moins de bonheur, de services statistiques  au sein de certaines administrations publiques parfois sans liens directs avec l\u2019INSD.   \n\nDans les secteurs para-public et priv\u00e9, le recours de plus en plus prononc\u00e9 \u00e0 une gestion moderne, a favoris\u00e9 la naissance de services statistiques, souvent bien organis\u00e9s (ONEA, SONABEL, ASECNA, BCEAO, etc.).  \n\nLa d\u00e9cennie des ann\u00e9es 80 a vu l\u2019implantation de Directions R\u00e9gionales du Plan, aujourd\u2019hui  Direction R\u00e9gionale de l\u2019Economie et du D\u00e9veloppement (DRED), avec des comp\u00e9tences statistiques et la g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisation au sein des diff\u00e9rents Minist\u00e8res, des Directions des Etudes et de la Planification (DEP), elles aussi dot\u00e9es de services \u00e0 comp\u00e9tence statistique. \n\nLes dirigeants de l'Institut National de la Statistique :\n\n de 1962 \u00e0 1978 Dr Georges SANOGOH  \n de 1978 \u00e0 1980 Mr. Cyril GOUNGOUNGA  \n de 1982 \u00e0 1983 Mr. Jean DONDASSE  \n de 1983 \u00e0 1988 Mr. Lassan\u00e9 DERA  \n de 1988 \u00e0 1992 Mr. Th\u00e9odore Z.

Currently, the Chief Statistician reports to the Minister of Industry.",
                    "Organizational structure and finance": "The Minister of Industry is the Minister responsible to Parliament for Statistics Canada. The Agency is headed by a Deputy-Minister, the Chief Statistician of Canada, who is supported by seven Assistant Chief Statisticians: four are responsible for program areas and three for technical and management operations in support of the operational programs. \n\nIn addition to the functional organizational structure, Statistics Canada employs a matrix structure to govern the way it plans its activities, allocates and manages its resources, and carry-out its operations. For example, for a given survey, the program area (subject matter) responsible for the survey uses the services of centralised expertise in survey methodology, systems developments, survey collection and processing, data dissemination, etc. This matrix structure has enabled Statistics Canada to consolidate its infrastructure functions to achieve efficiencies, to increase flexibility, and to maintain centres of technical expertise. Financial resources are managed both from a survey area (program) viewpoint as well as from a service area (functional) viewpoint. The Agency also uses ad hoc project teams to creatively solve technical or program challenges. These project teams are multi-disciplinary and cut across program and organizational lines.",
                    "Multi-annual or annual work program": "The Statistics Canada (NSO) has an ongoing work program which is modified on the margin every year through redistribution of resources based on user priorities and program needs. In addition the program is supplemented by separately funded cyclical programs (e.g. the Census of Population) and cost recovery work that is paid for by external clients, primarily other Government ministries.",
                    "Main duties": "Under the Statistics Act, Statistics Canada is required to \"collect, compile, analyse, abstract and publish statistical information relating to the commercial, industrial, financial, social, economic and general activities and conditions of the people of Canada.\"\n\nStatistics Canada has two main objectives:\n\n1. To provide statistical information and analysis about Canada's economic and social structure to: \n\no  develop and evaluate public policies and programs \n\no  improve public and private decision-making for the benefit of all Canadians. \n\n2. To promote sound statistical standards and practices by: \n\no  using common concepts and classifications to provide better quality data. \n\no  working with the provinces and territories to achieve greater efficiency in data collection and less duplication. \n\no  reducing the burden on respondents through greater use of data sharing agreements (sources used include annual tax records, monthly employee payroll records and customs records) \n\no  improving statistical methods and systems through joint research studies and projects. \n\nStatistics Canada produces statistics that help Canadians better understand their country-its population, resources, economy, society and culture.\n\nIn Canada, providing statistics is a federal responsibility. As Canada's central statistical agency, Statistics Canada is legislated to serve this function for the whole of Canada and each of the provinces.\n\nObjective statistical information is vital to an open and democratic society. It provides a solid foundation for informed decisions by elected representatives, businesses, unions and non-profit organizations, as well as individual Canadians.\n\nIn addition to conducting a Census every five years, there are about 350 active surveys on virtually all aspects of Canadian life.\n\nStatistics Canada is committed to protecting the confidentiality of all information entrusted to us and to ensuring that the information delivered is timely and relevant to Canadians."

The Act gave legislated form to existing government policies and to the recommendation of the Foster Commission of 1912 that a centralized and coordinated statistical system should be created.\n\nIn 1960, a Royal Commission, in one of its special studies, gave a strong endorsement to strengthening the centralized statistical system and ensuring the Bureau's independence. One recommendation was that the Bureau become a federal department in its own right and that the Dominion Statistician have the status of a deputy minister. By an Order-in-Council of January 6, 1965, the government accepted this recommendation.\n\nParliament passed a new Statistics Act in 1971. The legislation received Royal Assent on February 11 and was proclaimed May 1, 1971. By this Act, the Dominion Bureau of Statistics became Statistics Canada with a broader mandate: to collect, compile, analyse, abstract and publish statistical information relating to the commercial, industrial, financial, social, economic and general activities and condition of the people. The revised Act also gave Statistics Canada specific access to income tax returns and confirmed its general right of access to administrative data."

                    "Brief history and other relevant background information": "The very first official statistics on the Cayman Islands was the 1802 census, which was conducted by Edward Corbet, a staff aide to the Governor of Jamaica, Lieutenant General George Nugent. At that time Corbet recorded 933 residents on Grand Cayman, including 545 slaves. He reported that the sister islands of Cayman Brac and Little Cayman were uninhabited, being visited only by turtlers during the summer season. \nAs a dependency of Jamaica, experts were brought from Kingston to conduct statistical and economic surveys. With the launch of the West Indian Federation in 1959, Cayman ceased to be a dependency of Jamaica and gained its own constitution. During the intervening years, assistance came mainly from the British Development Division in the Caribbean, based in Barbados. \nCreation of the Portfolio of Finance \nIn 1955, the Treasury Department was created from what was previously the Department of Treasury, Customs and Post Office. Mr. Desmond V. Watler was appointed as Cayman\u2019s first Treasurer, with Mr. Vassel G. Johnson as Assistant Treasurer. \nIn 1969, the title of Treasurer was changed to Financial Secretary. Under the new constitution that came into effect in 1972, the Financial Secretary, Mr. Vassel G. Johnson, became an official member of Executive Council (Cabinet) with responsibilities for the following areas: Treasury, Savings Bank, Currency Board, Companies Registry, Bank Inspection, Development Unit, Exchange Control, Budget, and later Insurance, Statistics and Computers. \nChanging the Statistics Law in 1970 and 1996 \nA new Statistics Law was passed in March of 1970 to replaced Law 14 of 1967, which became obsolete as the Cayman Islands separated from Jamaica. It gave legal backing to the census conducted later that year. Despite the successful passage of this Law, the community at large was concerned about Government\u2019s increasing need for information. These fears were heightened when government started looking into the cost of living. Of particular concern was the invasion of privacy. \nThe Financial Secretary explained why it was important to collect the various economic and social statistics. Key users such as developers, and investors were surprised at the lack of information on the economy. \nThe Statistical Law was revised in 1996. The law is referred to as Statistics Law (1996 Revision) and is still in use. \nEvolution of the Economics & Statistics Office \nIt was not until 1976 that the Statistics Unit was established in the Portfolio of Finance with Mr. Ned Solomon, Executive Officer and Ms Carolyn Cupidon, Clerical Officer. In 1977, Mr. James A. Hunter was appointed as Sr. Assistant Secretary in the Portfolio of Finance with \nresponsibility for Development and Statistics. The total staff complement at that time was five, including the vacant post of Executive Officer. \nOn the 22nd October 1983, Mr. Graham Jones was seconded from the United Kingdom Statistical Services to become Cayman\u2019s first resident Statistician. His successor was Mr. Phillip Turnbull (1985-1990), whose post was upgraded to Chief Statistician in 1989. Other Chief Statisticians included Mrs. Penny Bassett (1990 -1992), Mr. Brian Boxill (1992-2003), and Mr. Christian Lajule (2003 \u2013 2004). \nIn 1986, Mr. D. M. Scott was recruited through the British Executive Services Overseas (BESO) as a short-term Economic Development Advisor. On a more permanent basis, Mr. Rudyard Robinson was appointed as Chief Economist and served in that capacity from 1988 to 1993. He was followed by Mr. Lyndon Martin who served as Assistant Economist between 1993 and 1995. \nBetween 1995 and 2000, the Economics & Statistics Office was created with Mr. Brian Boxill as Director and Dr. Elizabeth Parsan as Deputy Director responsible for Economics. The Economics section was separated from Statistics in 2000 and was headed by Dr. Parsan until 2003. The Economics & Statistics Office was finally reconstituted in 2003 under the Directorship of Ms. Catharine Read and with Mr. Christian Lajule as Chief Statistician.\n"

It defines mandatory operations, at the suggestion of the CPS, then decides on a general system of penalties that could be applied in the event of noncompliance with the obligation to respond, which may only be acted upon after respondents have been formally notified to report. The CSS is also the agency that adopts the statistical activity program when it is drafted. Lastly, the CSS plays a role in disputes and secrecy relative to statistics.\n\nThe CPS plays a technical role. It assists the CSS with its work and is in charge of preparing the medium-term and annual programs. It gives a reasoned opinion on mandatory statistical operations. Finally, the CPS also has the task of defining, in general terms, the methodological aspects of statistical operations. \n\nINSEED, for its part It is a public establishment with financial autonomy, the bulk of whose resources come from its share of the statistical tax, which is levied on customs revenue at a rate of 2 percent.

                    "Organizational structure and finance": "C&SD together with statistical units established in various government departments/bureaux form the Government Statistical Service (GSS). The latter are generally called the \"outposted statistical units\".\n\nBroadly speaking, most general-purpose statistics come under the responsibility of C&SD. The statistical units in various government departments/bureaux are responsible for specific-purpose statistics (for dedicated use in their respective work) and provide necessary support in the application of statistics.\n\nThe Commissioner for Census and Statistics is the Government's principal adviser on all statistical matters and the head of the GSS. On the one hand, he/she fulfills his/her responsibilities by being the head of C&SD and, on the other hand, coordinates the work of outposed statistical units and monitors their technical standards.\n\nThe Commissioner for Census and Statistics is assisted by a Deputy Commissioner and five Assistant Commissioners in discharging his/her duties. Each Assistant Commissioner heads a division. The functions of these five divisions are: \n\nEconomic Statistics Division (1): This Division deals with external merchandise trade statistics and price statistics;\n\nEconomic Statistics Division (2): This Division deals with sectoral economic statistics covering such sectors as manufacturing, construction, transport, business services, distributive trades, restaurants and hotels; providing data on such aspects as business performance, operating characteristics and trade in services. It also deals with statistics on science and technology, information technology usage and penetration in the business sector, and regional/local offices in Hong Kong representing parent companies located outside Hong Kong;\n\nEconomic Statistics Division (3): This Division deals with national income statistics and Balance of Payments statistics;\n\nSocial Statistics Division: This Division deals with demographic, labour force and other social statistics; plans and executes population censuses; conducts social surveys; and oversees the statistical units in a number of government departments; and \n\nGeneral Statistics Division: This Division deals with labour statistics and undertakes surveys of employment, payroll, wages and manpower; provides support in applications of information technology in the Department; organises human resources development activities; handles data dissemination matters; oversees statistical units in a number of government departments; and provides statistical professional services to other government departments.\n\nIn addition, there are three branches directly supervised by the Deputy Commissioner, namely Technical Secretariat, Development Branch and Administration Branch.",
                    "Multi-annual or annual work program": "C&SD maintains a corporate plan covering all its work programmes. For each programme, detailed summary of the resources involved, linkage to other work programmes, main outputs and their uses, efficiency initiatives and future developments are set out. Accounts of recent changes and challenges in the operation environments and how they have been or to be dealt with are also included to enable full anticipation of issues that may lie ahead. The plan is reviewed every year to ensure that C&SD can address the changing needs of its services in a timely manner.",
                    "Main duties": "The work of C&SD can be classified into three categories:\n\n(a) Conducting statistical surveys and operating statistical systems for the production of social and economic statistics including data series on such areas as population, external trade, commerce and industry, labour, prices, national income and Balance of Payments;\n\n(b) Performing statistical analysis and disseminating statistical data and analytical results; and\n\n(c) Providing consultation and support services on statistical matters to various government departments.\n\nProper understanding of the concepts and definitions of different kinds of statistics is imperative for their correct interpretation and application. Besides providing statistical data to the public, C&SD is also prepared to give advice on the interpretation and application of statistics so as to maximize their utility to users."

                    "Brief history and other relevant background information": "C&SD was set up in December 1967 by bringing together the Census and Statistical Planning Office of the then Colonial Secretariat and the Statistics Branch of the then Commerce and Industry Department.\n\nWhen the Department was first formed, its main duty was to compile the external trade statistics of Hong Kong. As regards statistical surveys, the first major job undertaken by the Department was the planning of the 1971 Population Census. In the same year, a Census of Manufacturing Establishments, being the first of its kind, was taken. This paved the way for the surveys on various economic sectors developed in subsequent years. Work also commenced to set up a system for compiling estimates of the Gross Domestic Product on a periodic basis.\n\nOver the past four decades, along with the rapid social and economic developments in Hong Kong, C&SD has been opening up new fronts and developing many social and economic statistical surveys and systems to meet the ever growing demands.\n\nIn carrying out its various activities, C&SD follows international standards and practices. In this regard, one of the major references is the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics adopted in 1994 by the United Nations. In the area of data dissemination, C&SD also complies with the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) of the International Monetary Fund. In addition, staff of C&SD also make regular reference to the Declaration of Professional Ethics of the International Statistical Institute.\n\nAs a professional department, C&SD places emphasis on a scientific and professional image, and always works with impartiality, integrity and objectivity. At the same time, great importance is attached to good quality of service, friendliness and smooth communication in providing services to the public."

Where appropriate, the practice of releasing provisional statistics is adopted for certain statistical series. With the provision of clear information about the revision practice and time schedule, users may apply the provisional statistics or the final figures to suit their needs at different times. Continuous efforts are made to shorten the time lag in releasing statistics.

                    "Brief history and other relevant background information": "La actividad Estad\u00edstica en Costa Rica se remonta hasta la \u00e9poca colonial cuando las autoridades recurr\u00edan a los registros parroquiales para realizar c\u00e1lculos poblacionales.\n\nDurante los primeros decenios de vida independiente, nuestros gobernantes bajo la idea unificadora de la Rep\u00fablica Federal Centroamericana, procedieron a levantar algunos registros censales fundamentalmente sobre poblaci\u00f3n total.\n\nId\u00e9ntico procedimiento se realiz\u00f3 simult\u00e1neamente en las dem\u00e1s provincias de la Rep\u00fablica Federal con prop\u00f3sitos claros de conocer realmente cu\u00e1ntos habitantes cobijaban la Federaci\u00f3n y su distribuci\u00f3n por edades y ocupaci\u00f3n. De esta base se parti\u00f3 en aras de realizar proyecciones sociales, econ\u00f3micas y militares, necesarias en \u00e9sa \u00e9poca.\n\nEn tiempos del Lic. Braulio Carrillo (1835) se realiz\u00f3 el primer Recuento de Vivienda del \u00e1rea central del pa\u00eds; desde la Independencia.\n\nEn ese Censo se incluy\u00f3 el n\u00famero total de habitantes por vivienda, desglosado por Jefe de familia, sexo y relaci\u00f3n.\n\nPara 1844, en el per\u00edodo Gubernativo de Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Alfaro, se realiza el Censo de Poblaci\u00f3n de ese a\u00f1o. Considerado como el primer intento realmente serio de registrar la poblaci\u00f3n total de Costa Rica y su condici\u00f3n socioecon\u00f3mica.\n\nSin embargo, m\u00e1s que un aut\u00e9ntico Censo de Poblaci\u00f3n, el de 1844 constituye un simple empadronamiento revisado y modificado con el Censo de 1864.\n\nDurante el mandato de Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Montealegre en 1861, su ministro o secretario en la Cartera de Gobernaci\u00f3n Francisco Mar\u00eda Iglesias, decide crear la Oficina Central de Estad\u00edstica, a cargo de la mencionada cartera para obtener todo lo referente a material censal y estad\u00edstico en el pa\u00eds.\n\nSimult\u00e1neamente a la decisi\u00f3n de Iglesias, el Ministro del Interior Lic. Aniceto Esquivel gestiona la aprobaci\u00f3n y Publicaci\u00f3n de la Ley No. 12 del 2 de julio de 1861 seg\u00fan la cual, se decretaba la realizaci\u00f3n de un Censo Nacional de Poblaci\u00f3n cada 10 a\u00f1os. Realmente en un primer momento la ley en cuesti\u00f3n no diferenciaba claramente Censo y Estad\u00edstica, lo cual dejaba incierta la aplicabilidad t\u00e9cnica del decreto.  Por ello, es que Iglesias crea la Oficina Central, comunicando mediante nota a los Gobernadores provinciales tanto la creaci\u00f3n como los alcances de la misma (25 de octubre de 1861).\n\nLa fundaci\u00f3n de la Oficina Central de Estad\u00edstica y la Ley de Censos vendr\u00eda a desembocar en el primer Censo General de Poblaci\u00f3n de 1864, dirigido por don Fernando Estreber, abogado y economista prusiano, designado Jefe de la Oficina Central de Estad\u00edstica desde 1861 hasta 1872 (a\u00f1o probable de su deceso).\n\nLuego de obtenidos los resultados del censo de 1864 (enviados por Estreber al entonces ministro de Gobernaci\u00f3n Juan J. Ulloa - 14 agosto de 1865), se procedi\u00f3 a depurar y mejorar los datos, hasta su publicaci\u00f3n definitiva en 1868.\n\nAl parecer, durante el primer decenio de existencia y pese a los exitosos resultados del Censo de 1864,  la Oficina Central de Estad\u00edstica sufri\u00f3 problemas de organizaci\u00f3n y administraci\u00f3n, por ejemplo, en 1869 Estreber se vio obligado a trabajar sin sueldo por muchos meses hasta que tal situaci\u00f3n es corregida mediante decreto No. 17 del 27 de setiembre de 1869 y ratificado por decreto No. 69 del 4 de octubre del mismo a\u00f1o.\n\nAs\u00ed mismo, en 1871, siendo Tom\u00e1s Guardia presidente del pa\u00eds y de nuevo Aniceto Esquivel ejerciendo como ministro, \u00e9ste env\u00eda al Consejo de Estado una propuesta para planear una organizaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s eficiente en el seno de la Oficina Central de Estad\u00edstica (5 de enero de 1871).\n\nA su vez el Consejo le refiere a la ley que para tal fin se hab\u00eda decretado bajo el No. 42 del 7 de octubre del a\u00f1o 1869.\n\nLa oficina Central de Estad\u00edstica desde su creaci\u00f3n se conform\u00f3 de un Director, un Oficial Mayor y un escribiente, adem\u00e1s, de alg\u00fan personal de apoyo (desde 1883).\n\nEn 1872 el Oficial Mayor de la oficina, Federico Maison es nombrado director con recargo a su puesto.\n\nEl se\u00f1or Maison permanece como director interino hasta 1875, cuando se suspende su nombramiento, provocado quiz\u00e1 en el hecho de asumir en ese a\u00f1o la direcci\u00f3n del Censo de Vivienda de Cartago el se\u00f1or Bernardo Capurro, Colombiano residente en Costa Rica desde 1874.\n\nCapurro abandona la actividad estad\u00edstica en 1876 para dedicarse a negocios particulares, ante lo cual se nombra en propiedad como director al Se\u00f1or Maison hasta 1881.\n\nAs\u00ed se llega al a\u00f1o 1883 cuando bajo la administraci\u00f3n de Pr\u00f3spero Fern\u00e1ndez se le da a la oficina la condici\u00f3n de Direcci\u00f3n General de Estad\u00edstica (ley No. 37 del 12 julio de 1883).\n\nEse a\u00f1o se nombr\u00f3 como director de la oficina y del censo a Enrique Villavicencio hasta 1893 inclusive, asumiendo la Direcci\u00f3n en 1894 el espa\u00f1ol Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Ferr\u00e1z.\n\nDe 1896 a 1901 funge Manuel Arag\u00f3n, a quien lo secundaron una serie de directores por cortos per\u00edodos de dos a\u00f1os cada uno, ellos fueron: Jos\u00e9 M. Cuervo (1902 - 1903), Manuel Gonz\u00e1lez Z. (1904 - 1905), Jos\u00e9 A. Lara (1906 - 1907).\n\nEl largo per\u00edodo comprendido entre 1908 y 1919, durante la ca\u00edda del r\u00e9gimen de los Tinoco, le corresponde ejercer como director al Lic. Jos\u00e9 M. Alfaro Cooper.\n\nDe 1920 a 1922 ocupa la Direcci\u00f3n el se\u00f1or Joaqu\u00edn Lizano y de 1922 a 1926 le corresponde a la primera mujer en ocupar ese puesto: Anita Pinto.\n\nDurante todo el gran per\u00edodo que va de 1894 a 1926 (32 a\u00f1os), no se realiza Censo de Poblaci\u00f3n en el pa\u00eds. En 1927 se efect\u00faa el cuarto Censo de Poblaci\u00f3n bajo la direcci\u00f3n del se\u00f1or Guillermo Vargas Calvo; Jos\u00e9 Guerrero asumi\u00f3 la jefatura del Censo.\n\nEntre 1933 y 1950 lo suceden Pr\u00f3spero Guardia, Sergio Carballo, Ram\u00f3n J. Rivera y Jos\u00e9 Guerrero (Director de la Oficina de Censos en 1949). A partir del a\u00f1o 1950 con Manuel Garc\u00eda V. (1948 - 1950, se inicia una etapa de renovaci\u00f3n en la actividad estad\u00edstica al promover la salida fuera de Costa Rica de una serie de funcionarios para capacitarse y que al regresar dar\u00e1n una importante inyecci\u00f3n de T\u00e9cnica y metodolog\u00eda a la Direcci\u00f3n y al Censo de 1950.\n\nCon la llegada en 1951 a la Direcci\u00f3n del Lic. Wilburg Jim\u00e9nez, es que se llega a unificar la Oficina de Censos con la Direcci\u00f3n General de Estad\u00edstica y Censos para asumir este nombre.\n\nEntre 1961 y 1985 ocuparon el puesto de Director: Rodrigo Bola\u00f1os S., Lic. Ren\u00e9 S\u00e1nchez (bajo cuya direcci\u00f3n estuvo el Censo de 1963 y el de 1973).\n\nAsumiendo finalmente el cargo de 1981 a 1985 el Lic. Rafael Trigueros M. (bajo cuya direcci\u00f3n estuvo el Censo de 1984), siendo la \u00faltima Directora la Licda. Virginia Rodr\u00edguez.\n\nEl 4 de noviembre de 1998, se crea mediante la ley No 7839 el Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica y Censos; la primera gesti\u00f3n en la gerencia la ocup\u00f3 hasta el 31 de octubre del a\u00f1o 2004 el Licenciado Jos\u00e9 Calvo Camacho.\n\nLa Licenciada Mar\u00eda Elena Gonz\u00e1lez Quesada asumi\u00f3 el cargo gerencial en forma interina desde el 1 de noviembre de ese a\u00f1o hasta el martes 31 de mayo de 2005.\n\nA partir del mi\u00e9rcoles 1 de junio de 2005 el Licenciado Jaime Vaglio Mu\u00f1oz, administrador p\u00fablico con un posgrado en mercadeo, figura como el nuevo gerente de la Instituci\u00f3n, cargo que ocupar\u00e1 hasta el 31 de mayo de 2011."

                    "Brief history and other relevant background information": "It was first in 1875 that the institution named the State Statistical Office was founded in the Kingdom of Croatia, Slavonia and Dalmatia.\n\nThen, in 1924, this institution changed its name to the Statistical Office in Zagreb. As early as 1929 the Office completely lost its financial and professional independence and, since then, it had formally been put under the state statistics of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.\n\nIn 1939, the Statistical Office was incorporated into the Presidential Office of the Vice-Roy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Government of the Banovina Hrvatska (the Banate of Croatia).\n\nFrom 1941 until 1945, there was the Office of the General State Statistics, in organisational sense, within the Government Presidency.\n\nThe year 1945 saw the establishment of the Statistical Office of the National Republic of Croatia. In 1951, this name was changed into the Bureau of Statistics and Records, then in 1956 to the Bureau of Statistics of the National Republic of Croatia, while in 1963 the name was changed once again to the State Bureau of Statistics of the Socialist Republic of Croatia. Considering finances and personnel, the Bureau was independent. On the other hand, it was obliged to implement uniform programmes and methodologies prescribed by the Federal Statistical Office.\n\nFinally, in 1992, the Republic of Croatia established the Croatian Bureau of Statistics, which has operated under the same name ever since. The Bureau is completely independent in its work, but with a strong tendency of harmonising, as much as possible, its programmes and methodologies with the statistics of the European Union.\n"

After 20 years of experience with this system, which was focused on economic data, a revised and expanded system of socio-economic recording was established in 1971.  Meanwhile, a Federal Statistical Office was created in 1968, along with central offices for the national republics - a Czech Statistical Office and a Slovak Statistical Office.  Following the split of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic into the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic on 1 January 1993, the Czech Statistical Office assumed all functions representing the Czech statistical service."

                    "Position in the government": "Statistics Denmark reports to the Minister of Economic and Internal Affairs. However, Statistics Denmark is an independent institution according to section 2 of the Act on Statistics Denmark. The independence implies that the Board of Statistics Denmark and the National Statistician (Director General) make decisions on the production and dissemination of statistics within the frameworks of national and international legislation. \n\nStatistics Denmark is the central authority for Danish statistics, cf. section 1 of the Act on Statistics Denmark and article 5 of EU\u2019s Statistical Law. This implies, among other things, that the greater part of Danish statistics on social and economic trends is produced by Statistics Denmark and that Statistics Denmark is responsible for coordinating Danish activities related to the development, production and dissemination of European statistics.",
                    "Organizational structure and finance": "LEADERSHIP\nThe leadership of Statistics Denmark is divided among the Board of Governors of Statistics Denmark, the Minister for Economic and Internal Affairs, and the National Statistician (Director General). The Board of Governors consists of seven persons with the National Statistician as chairperson; the other six members are designated by the Minister and must, according to the Act on Statistics Denmark, have insight into social and economic conditions. The Board of Governors prioritises work tasks and approves the budget. The Board of Governors also appoints advisory committees. The Minister has parliamentary responsibility, including responsibility for the Finance Act appropriation. The National Statistician is the professional and administrative manager of Statistics Denmark.\n\nORGANISATION\nStatistics Denmark is organised into five departments with 23 divisions altogether. Three of the five departments produce statistics according to the division described below. Besides there is a Department for Sales and Marketing and a Department for User Services. Additionally, there is a Management office responsible for, among other things, the international co-operation. The National Statistician, the Head of the management office, and the departmental directors constitute the management.\n\nTRIPARTITE STRUCTURE OF THE STATISTICAL PRODUCTION\nStatistics Denmark organises the statistical production into three main areas: social statistics, business statistics, and economic statistics.\n\n\u2022\tSocial statistics take the people of Denmark as a starting point: The composition and education of the population, the labour market, social conditions, income and criminality.\n\n\u2022\tBusiness statistics deal with production, the economy and business trends. In recent years, increased statistical attention has been focused on the service sector and the information society.\n\n\u2022\tEconomic statistics describe the general economic conditions in society and provide information on short-term trends. This includes statistics on national accounts, government finances, external trade and prices and consumption. \n\nAlthough, the production of statistics is divided into three distinct areas, Statistics Denmark stress cross-disciplinary co-operation \u2013 including tailor-made services for external customers.\n\nDYNAMICS \nThe organisation and the number of divisions are modified on a continuing basis. In recent years, we have moved towards a more specialised division of labour by establishing a new division, Survey and Methods, and a new department, Sales and Marketing. The goals of the new, partially functional, division is to focus more on two important areas of our work: We are creating optimal conditions for businesses that must use time to supply us with data, and we want to increase our income by professionalising the handling of customers.\n\nUSERS AND CUSTOMERS\nWe exist for our users, and our organisational plan emphasises this. In addition to IT and administration, the User Services Department includes a number of outward-oriented functions: library, information and dissemination. The Sales and Marketing Department takes care of certain important users \u2013 customers, researchers, and international consulting. Our user surveys show increasing use of our data and services by ordinary citizens, governmental authorities, the media, business and researchers. They also show that the users are predominantly satisfied.  The vision of Statistics Denmark is to be one of Europe\u2019s most user-friendly statistical institutions and the institution integrating official statistics on social and economic conditions in Denmark. Read more about initiatives taken to improve user-friendliness in \u201cSTRATEGY 2015\u201d.\n\nEFFECIENCY AND INCOME\nStatistics Denmark is an efficient institution and places much stock in being recognised as such. We must use our resources effectively; we must be as competitive as possible with respect to the user-charged service activities; and we must continually try to reduce our publication time. An internal time registration system ensures that we can measure costs more precisely with respect to individual statistics and services.\n\nThe 2012 budget for Statistics Denmark is DKK 391,8 million (approx. EUR 52 million). The Finance Act appropriates a financial framework of approximately 70 per cent of the budget; the rest of the budget approximately 30 per cent, is financed by our own income. The Finance Act appropriation forms the basic framework for the on-going production of statistics. Every year, this appropriation is reduced by an amount corresponding to demands for improving productivity. \n\nIn relation to other official statistics agencies in the EU, a large share of Statistics Denmark\u2019s budget is financed from our own income. This income includes subsidies from the EU and Danish ministries to prepare and publish specific statistics and the sale of statistical publications. For a fee, we also undertake extensive work to compile and process statistical information for private and public customers.\n\nSTAFFING\nThe number of our employees, measured in man-years, has fallen from 608 in 2000 to 534 at the beginning of 2012. Excluding management positions, the share of academic staff has risen from 30 per cent in 2002 to around 45 per cent in 2012, corresponding to a decline in office personnel from 42 per cent to around 30 per cent. IT staff members make up around 11 per cent of the employees. 46 per cent of or our employees are women.\n\nOur increased focus on mobility and international co-operation ensures that we get an appropriate infusion of new blood. As colleagues, we feel part of a larger community with a very active staff association and a variety of tradition steeped social events. \n\nWe have an extensive internal education programme, utilising internal and external instructors, in which each professional group must complete a compulsory course of education. There are also excellent opportunities for continuing education outside the programme. \n\nIn \u201cSTRATEGY 2015\u201d you can read more about Statistics Denmark\u2019s vision to be an attractive workplace, which is able to recruit and maintain well qualified employees and managers.\n\n",
                    "Multi-annual or annual work program": "Every year Statistics Denmark publishes an annual work programme which gives an overview of work and planned new activities for the forthcoming year, agreed upon by the Board of Governors. Annual work programmes are prepared within the framework of the multi-annual work programme (corporate strategy), which contains goals five years ahead. Annual work programmes and the corporate strategy are published on paper and web. \nThe current Multi-annual programme is called \u201cSTRATEGY 2015\u201d and is available on this site.  \u201cSTRATEGY 2015\u201d lays out the following 8 areas for action towards 2015: 1) Involvement of users; 2) Reductions in the response burden; 3) Development of statistics; 4) Reliable and timely statistics; 5) Dissemination of statistics; 6) User charges, 7) Employees and managers, 8) Work processes and IT support. Read more about each of the actions areas in \u201cSTRATEGY 2015\u201d. \n",
                    "Main duties": "The main duties of Statistics Denmark are set out in the Act on Statistics Denmark and can be summarized as the following three main tasks:\n\n1) The first task is to collect, process, and publish statistical information on social and economic conditions. This may be carried out in cooperation with other producers of statistics. Furthermore, statistical analyses and forecasts may be prepared. The institution may also assist committees and commissions in statistical matters. \n\n2) The second task is to contribute to the international statistical cooperation. As a member of the EU, Denmark enters into a legally binding statistical cooperation. In this context, Statistics Denmark is responsible for coordinating all Danish contributions of data to the European Statistics. Statistics Denmark is also actively involved in the statistical activities in the UN, OECD, IMF and in the Nordic countries.\n\n3) The third task is to carry out statistical tasks for private and public customers for a charge. These tasks are conducted in accordance with the Government\u2019s rules for user charges. \n"

                    "Brief history and other relevant background information": "DEMOCRACY \nIn January 1850 Denmark\u2019s statistical institution was founded under the name the Statistical Bureau. The activities of the Bureau were initiated following the adoption of Denmark\u2019s Constitutional Act in 1849. In 1966 the Danish Parliament adopted the Act on Statistics Denmark. The Act was completely new and defined the independent status of the institution. The name was changed to Statistics Denmark and the title of the head was changed from Permanent Secretary to National Statistician. Today, the activities of Statistics Denmark are carried out in accordance with this Act, as subsequently amended, and the European Parliament and Council Regulation on European Statistics from 2009, called EU\u2019s Statistical Law.\n\nMISSION AND VISION \nThe mission of Statistics Denmark is to produce impartial statistics on society as the basis for democracy and the national economy. Statistics Denmark\u2019s vision is to be: 1) one of Europe\u2019s most user-friendly and data supplier-friendly statistical institutions; 2) an effective and innovative institution solving tasks digitally; 3) the institution integrating the official statistics on all social and economic conditions; 4) an attractive workplace.\n\nCREDIBILITY\nThe production and dissemination of our statistics are in compliance with the UN\u2019s ten fundamental principles for official statistics as well as with the 15 principles that make up the European Statistics Code of Practice and is included in EU\u2019s Statistical Law. Statistics must be versatile and be compiled on a methodologically sound and non-partisan basis. No-one has access to our releases before anyone else, and all information concerning individuals and businesses is treated with confidentiality.\n\nQUALITY \nWe focus on maintaining a high quality at an international level, and comparisons and benchmarks demonstrate that we have succeeded. Read more about the initiatives taken to improve reliability and timeliness of statistical data in Statistics Denmark\u2019s \u201cSTRATEGY 2015\u201d.\n\nINTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION\nStatistics Denmark actively participates in European statistical co-operation and a number of other international statistical fora. We collaborate on a great many projects with statistics agencies both in the Nordic countries and throughout the world, and we are active in international consulting. \n\n\u2022\tEU: As a member of the European Union, Denmark is bound by approximately 200 legislative acts, whose purpose is to ensure uniform statistics among the member nations. These statistics provide a vital source of information for planning, monitoring and assessing a number of EU policies. EU legislation regulates approximately 70 percent of our statistical production based on Finance Act appropriations, and there is an increasing demand for timely, more detailed and new EU statistics. EU co-operation takes place in a comprehensive network of task forces, work groups and committees, with the European Statistical System Committee as the focal point.\n\n\u2022\tNORDIC COUNTRIES: The Nordic countries collaborate closely on statistics. Beyond an exchange of experiences at the annual meetings of Nordic Directors General, projects are implemented across national boundaries, including the development of tools for statistical databanks. Much of the exchange of experience in the Nordic countries takes place in network groups. As a result of this Nordic co-operation, the Nordic Statistical Yearbook is published each year.\n\n\u2022\tUN: Statistics Denmark works with the UN to encourage the harmonisation of statistics and international division of labour for the development of statistics. Statistics Denmark also participates in international statistical cooperation through organisations such as the OECD, the IMF and the ILO.\n\n\u2022\tCONSULTATION: Since the beginning of the 1990s, Statistics Denmark has provided consulting services to other national statistics agencies, particularly in Mozambique, Uganda, Egypt, the Baltics, the Balkans and Central and Eastern Europe. The projects have been primarily financed by contributions from Denmark and the EU.

Thus Statistics Denmark has full access to all administrative registers. \n\nDATA FROM REGISTERS\nMost of the data we use derives, by far, from information supplied by the administrative registers of governmental agencies. Denmark began early to use registers for statistical purposes and has continued to be an international innovator in this area. The uniform registration of inhabitants in the Central Population Register and businesses with their affiliated production units in the Central Business Register is a prerequisite for this use. \n\nRegister-based statistics give us clear advantages both with respect to resource consumption and opportunities for cross-disciplinary analysis. Register-based labour force statistics link labour market information with demographic and social data; while the Register of Building and Dwelling Statistics couples geographic and demographic data with, for example, information on income, social services, and education. The use of public registers helps further to limit burdens on data suppliers. \n\nRead more about register based statistics in \u201cRegister based statistics in the Nordic countries. Review of best practices with focus on population and social statistics\u201d, UNECE (2007).\n\nINTERVIEWS\nWe get additional data for our social statistics through telephone interviews. This is true, among other things, for our on-going labour force survey, which has been expanded to around 22,000 interviews quarterly. Our Interview Service contributes to our own surveys and sell services to external costumers.\n\nBUSINESS DATA\nIn addition to data from public registers, information is supplied by for example labour market organisations that already gather information from members. We also collect data through sample surveys, in special cases, a census of an entire sector.\n\nRESPONSE BURDEN\nIt is a central goal for Statistics Denmark to collect adequate and accurate statistical information with the least possible burden on businesses. Around 99 per cent of the reporting duties that Statistics Denmark imposes on businesses are related to EU legislation. The overall cost of the response burden has been calculated at DKK120 million (approx. EUR 16 million). We are continually working within the given parameters to optimise and reduce the size of sample surveys. We have also limited the maximum number of statistics, to which small businesses must report, to three a year. Read more about Statistics Denmark\u2019s initiatives to reduce the burden on respondents in \u201cSTRATEGY 2015\u201d and in the paper \u201cEfforts made by Statistics Denmark to reduce the response burden\u201d.\n",
                    "Data confidentiality": "We treat information about individuals and businesses confidentially. Upon their employment, all our staff members sign a statement acknowledging a duty of confidentiality.  Individuals and businesses remain anonymous in the statistics we make public. However, from democratic concerns, governmental authorities have no right to anonymity. We do not disclose confidential information for administrative purposes.\n\nBeyond the general provisions of the Danish Public Administration Act and the Danish Penal Code, we conduct our work pursuant to the act on processing of Personal Data. The Danish Data Protection Agency monitors that we obey the law. In special instances, the Data Protection Agency may allow us to disclose information to another party \u2013 for example, in the case of a collaboration to produce statistics. The Data Protection Agency may also grant permission for us to exchange confidential information with another national statistics institution as a part of a collaboration. \n\nStatistics Denmark implements strict security measures to protect our statistical registers from misuse. We ensure that no-one unauthorised gains access to sensitive information about people and businesses and that the information is used exclusively for statistical purposes. \n"

In order for Danish society and the international community to benefit from this vast amount of statistical knowledge, we make it available in a wide variety of forms in both Danish and English. \n\nSTATBANK DENMARK\nStatBank Denmark contains several billion figures. They are presented in several thousand tables and describe most aspects of Danish society. By comparison internationally, StatBank Denmark is a very user-friendly data bank, and users\nextract more than 150,000 tables a month. It is easy to extract tables in the form of graphics or maps, and a huge quantity of numbers may be downloaded and saved in spreadsheets and other formats, including a free PC-Axis program. The statistical databank has a complete parallel version in English, which can be found at: http://www.statbank.dk/statbank5a/default.asp?w=1280 \n\nDECLARATIONS OF CONTENT\nAll our statistics have an affiliated declaration of content, offering a comprehensive description of the sources and methods used. The declarations describe quality and content and are also presented in English. For each statistic we provide information about purpose, historicity, accuracy, reference period, publication date, and comparability over time. We also provide a contact person. Declarations of content are available at: http://www.dst.dk/en/Guide/documentation/Declarations.aspx\n\nLIBRARY\nStatistics Denmark Library is open to the public. As the principal library for descriptive statistics on Denmark, it contains not only the largest collection of statistics in Denmark, but also a broad array of statistical publications from countries all over the world and from international organisations.\n\nTHE MEDIA\nIn recent years, we have professionalized our media relations. Through our detailed press database, we have a unique overview of the increasing coverage individual publications receive. Our employees attend communication and press courses. Contact with journalists is decentralised, and a colleague who usually works with a particular set of statistics is also typically the person to make any statements about it.\u201dNEWS FROM STATISTICS DENMARK\u201d is the result of a dialogue between statistics and communication staff members and is geared to make it easy for the press to use. The press also frequently cites background articles form our online magazine, \u201cNETMAGASINET BAG TALLENE\u201d (in Danish only). We also systematically monitor weblogs. We actively correct any misundrestandings or misuse of our statistics in the various media. \n",

We grant such authorisation pursuant to a concrete assessment, and the authorised researchers have the same duty of confidentiality as Statistics Denmark staff members. For educational use, we supply non-confidential, sample survey-based datasets that are constructed in such a way that it is not possible to identify persons or businesses. \n\nWe are constantly working to strengthen Danish register-based research by giving researchers access to tailor-made sets of data compiled from various registers at Statistics Denmark. We have developed special research databases such as the Fertility Database, the Pharmaceutical Database, and the Integrated Database for Labour Market Research. The Research Services of Statistics Denmark provide consulting services free of charge in connection with new research projects. Researchers and businesses may also request interview-based surveys. \n\nRead more about access to microdata for research purposes in the working paper \u201cNew developments in the Danish system for access to micro data\u201d, UNECE/Eurostat (2005).\n"

                    "Brief history and other relevant background information": "The first statistical records about the territory of Estonia date back to the distant past. The Danish Estimation Book (Liber Census Daniae), compiled in the second half of the 13th century, comprises exact data about the agricultural land of North Estonia. During the Czarist period the collection of statistical data was carried out by the Statistical Committee of Estonian Province (Gubernya) that had been founded on 10 May 1863. On the initiative of its secretary Paul Jordan two population censuses were organised in Estonia: in Tallinn in 1871 and in the whole Estonia in 1881. The statistical committee of the province terminated its activity in 1917.\n\nIn the Republic of Estonia, the State Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) was established on 1 March 1921. It was headed until the Soviet occupation by Albert Pullerits, and took orders from the Head of the Chancery. Principal questions were discussed by the State Council of Statistics, chaired by the Head of the Chancery and the Director of CBS acting as his deputy. Statistical bureaus worked both in Tallinn and Tartu. Several county governments had their own statistical services. Additionally, there were around one thousand agricultural correspondents.\n\nAt the beginning of the Soviet occupation, the State Accounting Board was established at the State Planning Committee with the decree of 25 October 1940 of the Soviet of People's Commissars of the Estonian SSR. Later it was changed into the Central Board of Statistics of the Estonian SSR that was subordinated to the Central Board of Statistics (Statistical Committee) of the USSR.\n\nUntil 1990, the then statistical organisation, the State Statistical Committee of the Estonian SSR, was part of the statistical system of the Soviet Union. However, it should be mentioned that thanks to the so-called \"perestroika\" the role of and control by Moscow had significantly decreased. The dependence on the USSR Statistical Committee was already quite insignificant and a good opportunity lent itself to start to develop the statistical system of independent Estonia. An important milestone was the adoption of the Statistics Law in 1990. This was the first legal act of its kind in the former Soviet Union. In 1990 the State Statistical Committee of the Estonian SSR was renamed the State Statistical Office of the Estonian SSR.\n\nAfter Estonia regained independence in 1991 the state statistical system had to be shifted from the interests of a planned economy to those of a market economy and had to be reformed to satisfy the needs of Estonia as an independent country. Estonian statistics stepped into a new, transitional period. At the first stage of the transitional period the most important task was to create appropriate conditions and an appropriate infrastructure that would have enabled Estonian statistics to be brought into compliance with the international requirements and those of the European Union better and more effectively.\n\n1992 marked the setting up of the Estonian Statistical Society. The Society aimed at uniting statisticians working in different fields and different places. The Society is mainly engaged in organising scientific conferences, publishing and international communication.\n\nTo perform efficiently the tasks assigned there was a thorough administrative restructuring at the Statistical Office in 1993. On 1 September 1993 the Statistical Office of Estonia started to create a modern system of producing statistics according to a specific plan of activities on the basis of a new organisational structure and with the staff chosen by competition. On 1 September 1993 a public statistical library was opened at the Statistical Office to better serve both the users and the employees of the Statistical Office and to satisfy their needs for statistics. A milestone in the activities of the Statistical Office was the year 1995 when on 30 March Eurostat and the statistical offices of the Baltic States signed a common declaration. This opened up new opportunities for the employees of the Statistical Office to participate in Eurostat workshops, seminars, courses and to establish contacts with all the EU MS and Phare countries.\n\nThe Government of the Republic approved by the Protocol of the 10 September 1996 session \"The main directions of development of the Estonian statistical system\". In 1997 the Official Statistics Act was passed. The Statistical Office also participated in drawing up the draft. In 2000 the Official Statistics Act was supplemented by several significant provisions. Among others, the Statistical Office was given the right to directly communicate with all government agencies in issues relating to the conduct of statistical surveys. In 1998 the Population and Housing Census Act was passed, in 2000 - the Agricultural Act.\n\nSince 30 April 2001 users have had access to the public statistical database. \n\nA Population and Housing Census was conducted from 31 March till 9 April 2000. An Agricultural Census was conducted from 15 July to 29 July 2001. It was the first agricultural census in Estonia after 1939.\n\nIn the years 2002-2003 work on the preparation of the Accession Agreement to the European Union has been significant.\n\nIn 1st of August 2010 a new Official Statistics Act enterd into force.\n"

                    "Brief history and other relevant background information": "Before INSEE\n\nIn 1833, at the Ministry of Trade, a General Statistics Office was created, which in 1840 took the name it was to keep until 1941: Statistique G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la France (SGF). At the end of 1936, this became a department of the Ministry of the National Economy. In particular, SGF produced demographic statistics and price indices. It coordinated statistics from all sources and disseminated them in the Statistics Directory (created in 1878), the Bulletin of general statistics in France (created in 1911) and specifically targeted publications.\n\nIn 1941 the National Statistics Service (Service National des Statistiques, SNS) was created, taking on many staff from the former army recruitment offices, as well as recovering tabulating equipment destined for the various regional offices.\n\n1946-1966: The construction of INSEE\n\nAgainst a backdrop of post-war reconstruction and reorganisation, INSEE was created according to the terms of the Budget Law of 27 April 1946, \"L'Institut national de la statistique et des \u00e9tudes \u00e9conomiques pour la m\u00e9tropole et la France d'outre-mer\", the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies for France and its overseas territories. From the outset, INSEE was given responsibility for managing administrative files, maintaining nomenclatures and producing statistics. The Law of 28 August 1946 gave INSEE responsibility for the electoral roll. The first national file of establishments was created by decree in 1948. The exploitation of administrative documents began with tax forms relating to wages (1947-1950). Survey techniques imported from the United States were used for surveys on family budgets, housing, health and labour costs.\n\nFrom 1961, national accounts work was carried out at INSEE, in line with international standards.\n\n1967-1987: INSEE affirms its independence and adapts to the requirements of users\n\nINSEE extended its information dissemination capacity, especially in the regions. In 1969, new publications were introduced, such as \u00c9conomie et statistique, Tendances de la conjoncture, Annales, and Informations Rapides. Statistical practices were evolving: more surveys were being carried out on households and companies, collecting much more varied data. 1969 was the year of the first annual survey of companies in industry and construction, which was completed by INSEE in 1972. The national accounts became quarterly in 1980 and were used as a framework for the Conjoncture in France publication.\n\nSince statistics departments could now be found in a growing number of the other administrations, INSEE strengthened its role as coordinator and gave these departments the necessary frameworks.\n\nSince 1988: Modernisation and participation in the European statistics system\n\nINSEE adapted its methods, not only for statistics but also for accounts or studies, to a more cyclical economy and one which was more open to the outside. New monitoring instruments were put in place, especially for underprivileged populations (e.g. survey of homeless people) and for new information and communication technologies (NICT).\n\nThe European institutional context became more restrictive within the Economic and Monetary Union. Quality norms - including norms in European regulations - had to be adhered to, especially in publication deadlines and \"meta-information\". INSEE adopted the use of the Internet, both for collecting data and for dissemination. From 2003, freely available information on the Internet became the rule. Finally, from 2004, the national census became an \"ongoing\" operation.\n\nTeaching and research were given fresh impetus by the decree of 2 June 1994 establishing the Group of National Schools of Economics and Statistics - Groupe des \u00e9coles nationales d'\u00e9conomie et de statistique (GENES).\n\nIn 2005, with the adoption at European level of the European Statistics Code of Practice, INSEE undertook to comply with principles shared by its partners.\n\nIn 2008 two European consultative bodies were set up following negotiations aiming to improve the quality of European statistics: the European Statistical Advisory Committee (ESAC) and the European Statistical Governance Advisory Board (ESGAB).\n\nWith the French law on the modernisation of the economy, adopted on 4 August 2008, the professional independence of INSEE is inscribed in the law.\n\nEC regulation n\u00b0223/2009 of the European Parliament and Council relating to European statistics defines a wide-ranging conceptual and operational framework for the compilation of European statistics.\n"

In the years of 1254-1258 Khan Arghun of Mongolia conducted the census of the population of Georgia and inventory of their assets. Since 1689, during the reign of Erekle I, chiefs of military-territorial units began conducting the population censuses in their regions once per seven years. The surviving books of XVII-XVIII cc. contain the data obtained from these censuses\n\nOn November 15, 1918 a temporary Bureau of Statistics was set up at the Ministry of Agriculture. The functions of the Bureau included developing the materials for conducting an agricultural inventory, recording the land bank and determining the norms for its distribution. On July 25, 1919 under the Law adopted by the Constituent Assembly, the Central Statistical Committee of the Republic was set up at the Ministry of Agriculture. The Committee was tasked to manage all the statistical works of state significance.\n\nAfter the Soviet occupation, on April 3, 1921 the Revolutionary Committee issued the Decree on Establishing the Central Statistics Division of Soviet Republic of Georgia and on July 4, 1921 the first charter for the state statistical bodies of Georgia was published. \n\nThe statistical activities carried out in Georgia till 1990s made up a portion of large scale statistics of the Soviet Union. The statistical activities were based on the Soviet standards and methodologies. \n\nAfter collapse of the Soviet Union, specifically in 1990s the need to make fundamental changes to all the tools and methods arose along with the need to identify different, alternative sources for obtaining the data. It became important to develop and introduce the indicators characteristic for a market economy. The characterization of institutional changes and ongoing reforms in the national economy became the subject of special interest. \n\nAt present the statistical activities are carried out by an independent body of National Statistics Service of Georgia (Geostat), the Legal Entity of Public Law. It carries out its functions taking into account the international methodology and standards. Since 11 December 2009 the Law of Georgia on Official Statistics provides a legal basis for its functioning."

                    "Organizational structure and finance": "President (Mr. Dieter Sarreither)\n\nVice-President (Mr. Dr. Georg Thiel)\n\nDepartment A  Administration, Administrative Cost Measurement\t\n\nDepartment B  Strategy and Planning, International Relations, Research and Communication\n\nDepartment C  Information Technology, Mathematical-Statistical Methods\n\nDepartment D  National Accounts, Labour Market, Prices\n\nDepartment E  Business Register, Earnings, Industry, Services\n\nDepartment F  Population, Finance and Taxes\n\nDepartment G  Agriculture, Environment, Foreign Trade\n\nDepartment H  Health, Social Statistics, Education, Households\n\n\nPosition in the government:\nThe president of the FSO is appointed by the Federal President on the proposal of the Federal Government. As a civil servant the term of office of the President of the FSO is unlimited until the completion of the 65 year of age (until 67 in the future). Dismissal is not possible as he/she is a civil servant. Removal from service would only be feasible based on disciplinary law. Because he/she is a civil servant he/she can be moved in principle to another (non statistical) post without a special reason. It never happened against the will of the person. If there is a political change in the government of the Federal Republic of Germany (if the government changes) this will have no impact on the position of the President of the FSO. He will not be removed from his post. In keeping with a long-standing tradition that dates back to the Reichstag elections, the Director of the Federal Office of Statistics is routinely assigned the duties of Federal Returning Officer.",
                    "Multi-annual or annual work program": "Annual Report 2015\n\nDestatis just published its annual report 2015. The report provides an insight on which national and international quality standards ensure official statistics in Germany. In an interview with Stefan Schweinfest, Director of Statistics of the UN in New York, Destatis is expanding its vision to the global statistics community.\n\nThe report also focuses on business statistics and particularly on statistics obtained from company data, such as those included in economic policy decisions, and describes how companies are affected. State Minister Prof. Helge Braun explained from a different perspective in an interview results from the survey of companies in connection with his duties, the office for measuring the reduction of administrative burden.\n\nThe Report is available only in German. The English version will be provided in August 2016 probably .\n\n\nThe statistical programme of the FSO is prepared and approved in the following way:\nRegular inquiry and listing of tasks for each year and for the multiannual planning in contact with the subject matter units, constant review of tasks, priority setting in a high-level meeting (President, Vice President, Heads of departments).\n\nThe multi-annual work programme is outlined in an integrated Strategy and Programme Plan of the FSO, which is an information document (not a legal act). The strategy and programme plan of the FSO for the years 2016-2020 was published in June 2016.\n\nThe Publication gives an overview about all statistical working areas and all responsible contact parters, lists all official statistics produced within the FSO, the most important publications and the current statistical tasks and those planned in the near future.\n\nBenefits of the Corporate Plan are: the orientation of planning processes towards the strategic goals; the participation of all departments in implementing the strategic goals, an overview of the entire work-programme by including the current and new activities of all areas of work, priority setting in compliance with available resources.\n\n\n",
                    "Main duties": "The assignment of the Federal Statistical Office is to provide and distribute objective and highly qualitative statistical information to all, namely politicians, government, administrative agencies, business and industry, and the citizens in general. \n\nThe special feature of the statistics of the Federal Statistical Office is that they are \"official\". This involves the obligation to produce reliable data following the principles of objectivity, neutrality, and scientific independence. The principles of statistical work and the tasks of the Federal Statistical Office are laid down in the Law on Statistics for Federal Purposes.\n\nIn accordance with the federal state and administrative structure of the Federal Republic of Germany, federation-wide official statistics (\"federal statistics\") are produced in cooperation between the Federal Statistical Office and the statistical offices of the 16 L\u00e4nder.\n\nAccording to the principle of regional decentralisation, the main tasks assigned to the FSO are the following:\n\u2022 methodological and technical preparation of federal statistics which are indispensable\n  for obtaining uniform data for the whole of Germany, and\n\u2022 the compilation and dissemination of federal data.\n\nThe uniform and timely data collection and processing up to the level of L\u00e4nder results, however, is generally the task of the 14 statistical offices of the L\u00e4nder (=federal states). The statistical offices of the L\u00e4nder are not agencies subordinate to the FSO but Land authorities which are entirely independent from the Federation in terms of organisation and funding.\n\nOne of the characteristic features of official statistics in Germany on the other hand is its functional centralisation. Much of the statistical work is carried out by special authorities set up for this purpose, i.e. the statistical offices at the federal, Land and local levels. In a few exceptional cases, other agencies have been entrusted with the production of federal statistics. Examples are the Deutsche Bundesbank (German Federal Bank) - which compiles the German data for the European Central Bank monetary and balance of payments statistics - and the Federal Labour Ageny - which produces parts of the labour market statistics.\n\nWith just a few exceptions, conducting the survey and processing the data up to Land results fall within the competence of the statistical offices of the L\u00e4nder.\n\nSome 2,212 staff members collect, process, present and analyse statistical information in the Wiesbaden, Bonn (and Berlin Information Point) in eight departments of the Federal Statistical Office. Six departments and the offices of the President and the Vice-President are located in Wiesbaden's main office, two  further departments are situated in the Bonn branch office. The Berlin Information Point, designed as the Office's service centre in the Federal capital of Berlin provides information and advisory services based on official statistical data to Members of the Bundestag, the German federal government, embassies, and federal authorities, to industry associations, and all those who are interested in official statistics in the Berlin-Brandenburg region. Up-to-date information and communication tools ensure smooth cooperation between the staff in the different places of employment. Apart from those tasks, the Wiesbaden main office runs the largest library specialised in statistical literature in Germany."

                    "Brief history and other relevant background information": "First efforts to compile official statistics on a continuous basis were made in Germany as early as in the 18th century. The statistical material which was collected at that time to provide a \"Description of State and National Life\" has been preserved until today. In the 19th century, statistical activities were extended, improved in methodological terms and, in particular, institutionalised in establishments set up for statistical purposes. Upon the foundation of the German Reich, a central statistical office named Kaiserliches Statistisches Amt (Imperial Statistical Office), which was subordinated to the Reichsamt des Innern (Reich Department of the Interior), was finally established in 1872. Apart from its responsibility for population statistics, the Office was gradually assigned new responsibilities regarding agricultural, transport, building activity and industrial production statistics and, as a result of the new social legislation, also social statistics. Another of its major functions was to coordinate and harmonise a large number of statistics of the Reich's individual states. Besides, the bodies of German official statistics have participated in the international exchange of experience and the development of statistical methodology under the umbrella of the International Statistical Institute (ISI) since 1853.\n\nAfter World War I, the responsibility for labour statistics was transferred from the then called Statistisches Reichsamt (Reich Statistical Office), which was subordinated to the newly established Reichswirtschaftsministerium (Reich Ministry of Economic Affairs), to the Reichsanstalt f\u00fcr Arbeitsvermittlung und Arbeitslosenversicherung (Reich Institute for Labour Placement and Unemployment Insurance). During the years of hyperinflation (1920 to 1923), short-term price and wage statistics were considerably enlarged. Upon the establishment of a unified Reichsfinanzverwaltung (Reich Finance Administration), detailed statistics of the finance situation of all public authorities were constructed and the existing tax statistics extended. In the context of the reparations negotiations between Germany and the victorious powers of World War I, the national income computation was developed as the predecessor of national accounting. And, as a result of increasing international contacts, statistics of foreign countries became very important, too.\n\nThe development of central state structures in the Third Reich resulted in an increased transfer of statistical activities from the states level to the Reich level. As a consequence of wartime economy, however, part of the functions of the Reich Office were transferred to other authorities and organisations.\n\nAfter the end of World War II in 1945, a statistical office of the British occupied zone was set up in Hamburg in 1946. In the American zone, Land statistical offices were established. Upon amalgamation of the British and American occupied zones, the Statistisches Amt des Vereinigten Wirtschaftsgebietes (Statistical Office of the United Economic Territory) was set up in 1948 which was transformed into the Federal Statistical Office after the foundation of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1949. Land statistical offices were then set up in all L\u00e4nder of the Federal Republic.\n\nAs regards the territory of the later German Democratic Republic (GDR), the Deutsche Zentralverwaltung f\u00fcr Statistik in der Sowjetischen Besatzungszone (German Central Statistical Board in the Soviet Occupied Zone) was founded in 1945. At the same time, Land statistical offices and district statistical offices were established. Between 1950 and 1952, the system of official statistics was centralised in the GDR. As a result, it encompassed a Central Statistical Board in Berlin (East), 15 county and 223 district offices.\n\nWith the German reunification on 3 October 1990, the statistical laws of the Federal Republic of Germany entered into force in the territory of the former GDR, too. Land statistical offices were set up in the new L\u00e4nder in a short period of time. Since January 1991, the major part of statistics in the new L\u00e4nder and Berlin-East have been produced along the lines of the concepts and methodology of federal statistics.\n\nToday, the Federal Republic of Germany has a Federal Statistical Office, 14 Land statistical offices and about 100 independent statistical offices at municipal and communal level. They are engaged in producing the vast majority of federal, Land and municipal statistics."

                    "Legal basis": "The main principles of the work of Official Statistics, namely the obligation to observe objectivity, neutrality, and scientific independence, the tasks of the Federal Statistical Office, and the provisions regarding statistical confidentiality, are laid down in the Federal Statistics Law (updated version of 21 July 2016). \n\nWhat applies to federal statistics in Germany is the principle of legality. This means that generally every individual statistics requires a specific legal basis (task of the legislative bodies). In its judgement of 15 December 1983 on the 1983 population census, the Federal Constitutional Court strengthened that link to a legal basis. According to that judgement, statistical surveys involving the obligation to provide information interfere with the constitutional right to informational self-determination. Such interference requires restrictive legal authorisation that is clearly defined in advance. Therefore, what is done in practice in Germany is that \u2013 with very few exceptions \u2013 laws are adopted that define all major parameters of any survey (especially variables, group of reporting units, periodicity).\n\nThe legal obligation ordering a federal statistics must determine whether and to what extent the survey is to be conducted with or without  an obligation  to provide information.  If an obligation to provide information has been stipulated, all natural legal persons under private and public law, associations of persons, public authorities of the Federation and the L\u00e4nder as well as communities and local authorities shall be liable  to reply to duly ordered questions.\n \nNowadays official Statistics in Germany are determined by a great number of European Laws as well (mainly regulations of the European Parliament and of the Council supplemented by regulations of the Commission)."

                    "Statistical advisory bodies": "In Germany, a so called Statistical Advisory Committee advises the FSO on fundamental issues and initiates plans for further developments. Moreover, the advisory committee prepares a report to the German Parliament at the end of the legislative term and evaluates proposals for the statistical programme of the past period and the period to come. The advisory committee has a purely advisory function; its legal provisions are laid down in article 4 of the Federal Statistics Law.\n\nThe Statistical Advisory Committee comprises representatives of all groups cooperating in the production of federal statistics as well as users and respondents (statistical offices of the L\u00e4nder, federal ministries, the Bundesbank, municipal central associations, business associations, trade unions and science), one representative of Eurostat and one representative of the German Council for Social and Economic data and one representative of environmental associations.It is convened once a year; these meetings are chaired by the President of the FSO. The statistical offices as well as the federal ministries have no right to vote (the committee has a purely advisory function).\n\nFor the adequate implementation of its tasks, the advisory committee has the right to establish expert committees and working parties dealing with special subjects. Discussions of expert committees can make it possible to tap the knowledge and the experience of external experts for the planning and development of official statistics. Users and respondents are given a chance to articulate their interests. At the same time, representatives of official statistics have the opportunity to explain their concern and to clarify the feasibility of proposals in discussions with the parties concerned. \n\nThe expert committees, as a rule, conform to the organisational structure of the FSO. Thus, for example, there are expert committees for statistics on manufacturing, environmental statistics or social statistics. But there are also expert committees for cross-sectional areas of statistics, such as classifications or regional statistics. The expert committees are chaired by the responsible departmental heads of the FSO.\n\n\nFurthermore there exists the Inter Ministerial Committe for Co-ordination and Rationalisation of statistics and the Conference of the President of the Federal Statistical Office and of the Heads of the Statistical Offices of the Laender"

                    "Access to administrative data": "Adminstrative data are used in German Federal Statistics to a great extent- especially in those statistical areas where statistics are traditionally produced as secondary statistics like education statistics, health statistics, finance and tax statistics and parts of the labour market statistics. Apart from that, increased efforts have been made for some years to use administrative data in economic statistics and to conduct a future population census on the basis of the population registers maintained by the municipalities.\n\nAs a general rule, the statistical offices only have access to administrative data sources if this is explicitly stipulated by law (examples: Law on statistical registers (Statistikregistergesetz) and Law on the use of administrative data (Verwaltungsdatenverwendungsgesetz)). General administrative registers with personal data do not exist in Germany. Each administration stores the data it needs in accordance with the relevant laws. It is strictly forbidden to use statistical surveys for updating registers outside the statistical offices. \n\nAccording to the law for the statistical register e.g. the following administrative files are used:\n\n- files from the tax authorities (VAT files, file of imcome and corporation tax\n\n- file from the Federal Institute for employment\n\n- files from the Chambers of Craft\n\n- files from the Federal Finance Office\n\n- files from the Chambers of Industry and Commerce",
                    "Data confidentiality": "Confidentiality in Germany is regulated by the Federal Data Protection Act. Section 5 of the Law states that persons employed in data processing shall not collect, process or use personal data without authorization (confidentiality). On taking up their duties such persons, in so far as they work for private bodies, shall be required to give an undertaking to maintain such confidentiality. This undertaking shall continue to be valid after termination of their activity.\n\nStatistics for Federal Purposes Act of 22 January 1987 protects confidentiality stricter than Federal Data Protection Law. Article 16 of the Law states that individual data on personal circumstances or the material situation provided for federal statistics shall not be disclosed by the incumbents and the person specially sworn in for public services who are entrusted with the\noperation of federal statistics unless otherwise stipulated by special legal provision. The obligation to confidentiality applies also to those persons who are recipients of individual data pursuant to a special legal provision or for the purpose of scientific projects.\nArticle 16 also regulates the transmission of the individual data between persons and agencies\nentrusted with the operation of federal statistics, the transmission of individual data to the\nL\u00e4nder statistical offices, to agencies of communities and local authorities and the transmission\nfor the purposes of scientific projects.\nThe respondents will be notified in writing or electronically about the rules governing statistical\nconfidentiality (Article 17 of the Law).\nInterview findings indicate that nobody has tried to identify an individual from data or statistical\noutput.\n\n\nAs regards the confidentiality of tables, methods of primary and secondary confidentiality have been developed and are used, also in co-operation with Eurostat. For business and agriculture surveys disclosure risk assessment is based on concentration-rules. Cell suppression is used to prevent residual disclosure in tables for dissemination."

                    "Availability of microdata for research purposes": "In 2001, the FSO established a research data centre, and another research data centre of the statistical offices of the L\u00e4nder was set up in March 2002 as a joint facility of all statistical offices of the L\u00e4nder with 15 regional locations. The major goal of the research data centres of the FSO and the statistical offices of the L\u00e4nder is to facilitate access to microdata of official statistics for the scientific community by establishing various ways of data use. \n\n\u2022 Absolutely anonymised data are modified by aggregation or by deletion of individual \n  variables to an extent making it impossible - as far as anyone can judge - to identify \n  respondents. Official statistics offers absolutely anonymised microdata in the form of \n  so-called Public Use Files (PUF). They are made available to anyone interested. \n\u2022 Microdata are referred to as being de facto anonymised when - although disclosure \n  cannot entirely be ruled out - the data can be matched with the relevant unit only by \n  making unreasonable efforts in terms of time, cost, and labour. This regulation is \n  based on \u00a7 16 of the Federal Statistics Law. The data sets created for that type of \n  use are referred to as Scientific Use Files (SUF).\n\u2022 Project-related data anonymisation is carried out when the demand for specific \n  statistics is low or when microdata are hard to anonymise, so that it would not be \n  reasonable to create standardised Scientific Use Files in a highly complex procedure. \n  Project-related anonymisation also creates de facto anonymity. However, the relevant \n  data can only be analysed on the premises of the research data centres of the \n  Federation and the L\u00e4nder, using so-called safe scientific workstations.\n\u2022 Using protected data stocks through controlled remote data processing is a rather \n  recent development, whose importance will grow in the future. These approaches allow \n  scientists to use the entire information potential of microdata material which is at \n  most formally anonymised. Scientists develop and transfer analysis programmes (syntax \n  scripts) which are then applied to the original data by the staff of the research data \n  centres. That service is currently offered for the programmes SPSS, SAS and STATA. In \n  contrast to Scientific Use Files, controlled remote data processing is not restricted \n  to a specific group of persons, thus enabling also foreign scientists and non-\n  scientific persons to use microdata of official statistics. \n\u2022 In the project \"An informational infratructure for the E-Science Age\" (InfinitE) the Research Data Centre develops the access to mcro data of the Official Statistics further in cooperation with partners. One focus is the production of syntactic and semantic data structure files, which allows the data external user a better preparation of their analysis of data from the Official Statistics. Another focus is to attain a progress in the automatic disclosure control of the results of this user analysis.   \n\nLink: www.forschungsdatenzentrum.de/en/index.asp\n\n\n"

The Board promotes the effective use of statistics and stimulates research activities in all fields of application of statistics. It also advises the government on the streamlining of departments of government with responsibilities for data collection, and also determines the manner in which data may be compiled by any person or authority in Ghana. \n\nThe Government Statistician is the head of the institution and he/she sees to the day-to-day administration of the service. He/she is appointed or dismissed by the Government on the advice of the Board and has two deputies who assist in the running of the Service. For Successful administration, the service is divided into divisions with each division headed by a divisional head of the rank of principal statistician and above. \n\nThe divisions are sub-divided into sections headed by sectional heads. Staffs of a section are made up of Technical Officers (with a minimum qualification of SSSCE) and professionals (comprising statisticians, demographers, economies etc., with a minimun of a Bachelor's degree).  Below is a simple monograph depicting the organizational structure.\n\nORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE\nDue to the Government's decentralization programme initiated in 1988, GSS has offices in all the ten administrative regions of the country under the headship of a Regional Statistician. There are statistical offices in some of the administrative districts of the country, and they are supervised by the regional Statisticians.",
                    "Multi-annual or annual work program": "GSS has a short to long term strategic plan for data collection in order to meet the statistical needs of the country.  In the short run, GSS has an annual task of price reading in order to produce monthly inflationary rates.  It also has a quarterly plan to produce prevailing data on all aspects of the economy.  In the medium term, it plans and organizes surveys with two to five-year intervals.  In the long run, it demarcates the nation into Enumeration Areas (EAs) for the conduct of census, which happens every ten years, on the basis of which a sampling frame for the intercensal surveys is developed.",

After a series of consultations the committee recommended that the Central Bureau of Statistics be established. In line with that, Statistics Act (Act 37) was passed in 1961. This law defined the structure, function and powers of the department.\n\nSubsequently, CBS expanded considerably because of the increasing demand for statistical information from the public and private sector, leading to the Statistical Service Law (PNDC Law 15) that established the GSS and its Board in 1985.

The evolution of statistics goes hand in hand with the evolution of public administration. In 1860 the Bureau of Public Finances was divided into 4 Departments, one of which was entitled the Department of Statistics. In 1910 a Department of Statistics was set up in the Ministry of National Economy responsible for collecting, processing and publishing all the National Statistics. At the same time a Council of Statistics was set up composed of University professors and representatives of the Chambers of commerce and industry. In 1925 the reorganisation of the Department of Statistics led to the creation of the General Statistical Service of Greece within the Ministry of National Economy. In 1929-1930 the Monthly Bulletin and the Statistical Yearbook were published for the first time. During the 1953-1956 the basis for the creation of a modernised Statistical Service was laid down. Instrumental to these efforts was the contribution made by experts from the UN organisation. In 1956 the National Statistical Service of Greece (NSSG) was established by the legislative decree no 3627. The NSSG is a public agency supervised by the Ministry of Economy and Finance, responsible for the conduct and dissemination of official statistics. Provision has been made in specific articles of the foundation law 3627/56 and the law 2392/96 so as to ensure confidentiality of individual data. These laws govern all individual statistics produced by the NSSG."

Since then, 11 population censuses have been held, and 6 housing censuses. The first 5 censuses were combinations of actual enumerating and estimates. Since 1950, censuses have been executed on the basis of UN Recommendations. The 2002 census was a 'de jure' enumeration.\n\nIndependientemente de las Estad\u00edsticas de Comercio en las colonias, las cuales eran responsabilidad de la Metr\u00f3poli, el \u00fanico testimonio de la actividad estad\u00edstica en Guatemala fue el Censo de Poblaci\u00f3n levantado por las autoridades Eclesi\u00e1sticas en 1778, circunscritas a la provincia de Guatemala.\n\nLa \u00fanica actividad estad\u00edstica relevante en esa \u00e9poca fue el registro parroquial de nacimientos, matrimonios y defunciones (en cumplimiento a lo dispuesto en el Concilio de Trento), aunque los mismos se realizaban con prop\u00f3sito religioso m\u00e1s que estad\u00edstico. Es a partir de la Independencia en 1821, como consecuencia de las ideas liberales procedentes de Europa y la comunicaci\u00f3n y el intercambio internacional, cuando aparecen en Guatemala los primeros intentos formales de realizar la actividad estad\u00edstica.\n\nEn 1986/87 se inicia el Sistema Nacional de En cuestas de Hogares, en 1994 se realiza el X Censo Nacional de Poblaci\u00f3n y V de Habitaci\u00f3n. En 1995/98 se realiza la encuesta Nacional Salud Materno Infantil. En 1998-1999 se realiza la Segunda encuesta Nacional de Ingresos y Gastos Familiares \u2013 ENIGFAM- y es esta la que sienta las bases para el nuevo \u00edndice de precios al consumidor del a\u00f1o 2000, IPC actual y uno de los m\u00e1s modernos de latinoam\u00e9rica. En el a\u00f1o 2000 la Encuesta Nacional sobre Condiciones de Vida de los Hogares, ENCOVI 2000 ampl\u00eda el universo de informaci\u00f3n que el INE ofrece a los usuarios. En noviembre del 2002 se realiz\u00f3 el XI Censo Nacional de Poblaci\u00f3n y el VI Censo Nacional de Habitaci\u00f3n cuyos resultados fueron presentados en febrero del 2003. En mayo del 2003 se levant\u00f3 el IV Censo Nacional Agropecuario y en Junio se public\u00f3 el estudio sobre el trabajo infantil en Guatemala."

The Bureau is recognised as the central authority on statistics in this country, and is often requested to advise and assist ministries and private/public sector organisations on statistical matters, and is the obvious member of the Guyana team for reviews of the IMF structural adjustment programmes and similar activities."

                    "Brief history and other relevant background information": "OVERVIEW OF INDIAN STATISTICAL SYSTEM\nThe Indian Statistical System functions within the overall administrative set up of the country.  India has a federal structure of Government.  The division of responsibility for administration between the Union Government and the State Governments is on the basis of three-fold classification of all subjects, namely,  the Union List, the State List,  and the Concurrent List.  The last category represents the areas where both the Union and State Governments can operate.  The subject Statistics is in this list, but conduct of surveys is in the Union List.  There is a further division of responsibility, by subjects or groups of subjects, among the different Ministries/Departments of the Union Government and among the Departments of State Governments, respectively, on the basis of their administrative functions.\n\nIn accordance with this structure, the Indian Statistical System is both decentralised and centralised. Large-scale statistical operations such as Population Census, Economic Census, Agricultural Census and Livestock Census and nation-wide sample surveys including the Annual Survey of Industries and the Socio-Economic surveys, as well as, compilation of macro-economic aggregates like national accounts, price indices and industrial production, are largely Central activities. The State Governments and statistical organisations of the States also collect and generate data on a number of variables.  \n\nThe Central Government acts as the coordinating agency for presentation of statistics on an all-India basis even in fields where the States have the primary authority and responsibility for collection of statistics.  The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation  is the nodal agency for all statistical activities at all-India level.  The State Directorates of Economics and Statistics (DESs) carry out the responsibility of coordination of all statistical activities at the State level and keeping liaison with the MOSPI for the purpose of coordination at all-India level.\n\nEVOLUTION OF MOSPI\nThe Central Statistical Organisation (CSO), which was initially set up as a Statistical Unit in the Cabinet Secretariat in 1949, became an independent organization in 1951.  Subsequently, the National Sample Survey was set up as a fact-finding body in 1950.  In 1961, a full-fledged Department of Statistics was created covering the CSO and the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO).   The Computer Centre providing common service electronic data processing facilities was set up as an attached office of the Department of Statistics in 1966.  In 1973, the Department of Statistics was transferred to the Ministry of Planning, to ensure effective coordination between planning and statistical activities.  In February, 1999, the Department of Statistics and the Department of Programme Implementation were merged to form the Department of Statistics and Programme Implementation and in October, 1999, the Department of Statistics and Programme Implementation became the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation.\n\nThe Ministry has two wings, one relating to Statistics and the other is Programme Implementation. The Statistics Wing consists of the Central Statistical Organisation (CSO), the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) and the Computer Centre. The Programme Implementation Wing has four Divisions, namely, (i) Twenty Point Programme Division, (ii) Infrastructure Monitoring Division, (iii) Project Monitoring Division and (iv) Member of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme Division.The Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), which is a premier statistical institute, receives budgetary support from the MOSPI.\n\nThe Government of India Resolution of 1st June 2005 proposes to set up a Statutory Commission, namely, the National Statistical Commission (NSC) consisting of a part-time Chairperson, four part-time Members, one each from the fields (a) economic statistics; (b) social and environment statistics; (c) censuses and surveys; and (d) national accounts and state statistical systems, and Secretary, Planning Commission as Members.  The Chief Statistician of India would serve as Secretary to the NSC.\n\nAlongwith the establishment of the NSC, the CSO and the NSSO will be merged into the National Statistical Organisation (NSO), to be headed by the Chief Statistician of India (CSI).  The NSO will have two wings, namely, (i) Central Statistics Office (CSO) and (ii) National Sample Survey Office (NSSO)."

The main Statistics Act under which data is collected by the MOSPI is the \u2018Collection of Statistics Act \u20181953.  The other most important Act for collection of statistics on demographic aspects of population is the \u2018Population Census Act 1948\u2019, which is administered by the Office of the Registral Genral of India, functioning  under the Ministry of Home Affairs.  Besides these two important Acts, there are a number of Acts, Rules and Procedures being administered by various administrative  agencies on their subjects, through which statutory returns are collected  by these Ministries/Departments. \n\nCollection of Statistics Act 1953\nThe Collection of Statistics Act 1953 empowers the Centre as well as State Governments to collect statistics in regard to any matter concerning industry or class of industries, commercial trading and industrial concerns including factories and matters relating to welfare of labour and condition of labour.  The MOSPI collects data on manufacturing establishments through the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI), using the Provisions of this Act.  \n\nThis Act specifies that the Central and State Government may appoint a statistical Authority, who in turn, may serve, on the owner of an industrial or a commercial concern or an individual, a notice requiring him/her to furnish certain  listed information about the industrial unit.  It confers the right   of access to relevant records or documents and restricts publication of any information  disclosing the identity of the industrial unit.  It also provides for certain penalties for willfully refusing  to furnish, or , the furnishing of false information.  \n\nCensus Act, 1948 \nThe Population Census, which is a Union subject, is conducted under the Census Act, 1948.  The Act empowers the Central Government to take a Population Census of the country after duly notifying its intention to do so.  It empowers the Central Government to appoint Census Commissioner and State Governments Census officers to take the census.  The Census Act is utilized for fixing primary administrative responsibility, for obtaining necessary funds, for determining the general scope and timing of the Census, for placing a legal obligation upon the people to give truthful answers, and for placing a legal obligation upon the enumerator to record the responses faithfully.  While the Act makes it obligatory for the public to answer all questions faithfully, simultaneously, it guarantees confidentiality of information in respect of individuals.  It provides penalties for (a) census officers if they fail in their official work and (b) the respondents if they provide wrong information.  The Act has been further amended vide the Census (Amendment) Act 1993."

Registration of birth, death,\nmarriage and divorce by the Department required the establishment of an organization responsible for\ncollection of information on the country's population. This led to the approval of a regulation in 1924, the\ndepartment responsible for statistics and its duties was determined and responsibility for collection and\ncentralization of necessary statistics was entrusted to the Ministry of the Interior.\nIn June 1939, the first census law was approved by National Council Parliament. Based on the law, put\ninto effect from March 1940, the population census was taken only in Tehran, and in 1940 and 1941, 33\ncities were gradually enumerated. In March 1952, Cooperation Organization of Public Statistics was\nestablished. Statistics and census law was approved in April 1958. In that year, Department of Statistics\nand Census detached from the General Department of Statistics and Civil Registration and joined the\nCooperation Organization of Public Statistics. Thus, for the first time, an organization, exclusively\nresponsible for collection of statistics, was established and was renamed Department of Public Statistics\naffiliated to the Ministry of the Interior in 1956.\nThe Department implemented the first national census of population and housing in 1956. Upon\nestablishment of the Department of Public Statistics, statistical activities entered a new stage and different\nkinds of surveys were annually executed in different socio-economic areas the most important of which\nare as follows:\n- Agriculture Survey in 1960\n- Population Sample Survey in 1963\n- Manufacturing Establishments Census in 1963\n- Household Budget Survey in 1963\nAccording to the 1965 Law and due to increasing requirements of planning organizations for information\nand statistics as well as the necessity of very close collaboration of main organization producing statistics\nwith the planning organizations, the Department of Public Statistics was detached from the Ministry of\nthe Interior and transformed into the Statistical Center of Iran (SCI) affiliated to the then Plan and Budget\nOrganization.\nIn 2000, the Plan and Budget Organization and the State Organization for Employment and\nAdministrative Affairs merged together into Management and Planning Organization, to which the SCI is\nnow affiliated. In 2007, Organization of Management and Planning changed to Vice Presidency of\nPlanning and Strategic Supervision.

The work program of the CBS comprises three main components:\n\n1)  Ongoing activities which are repeated on a regular basis (such as the LFS, or the annual publication of statistics on higher education);\n\n2) Special, one-off projects;\n\n3) Development work.

This information is also given to academic research institutions and the general public. In addition, the Bureau is responsible for coordinating statistical activity of government institutions and advising them on statistical issues.\n\nThe work of the CBS is done at a standard which is internationally accepted by most nations of the world and this enables comparisons of statistical information between Israel and different countries. The Bureau is empowered by the order of statistics (new version) 1972. Its main work focuses on preparing statistical data - current, monthly, quarterly and annually - on the following subjects: the national economy (product, consumption, capital formation, labour productivity, savings), the balance of payments and foreign trade, activity of the different industries of the economy (agriculture, manufacturing, construction, transport, commerce and services, etc.), price changes of goods and services, the population (its composition an factors of its growth), families and their financial and social situation (size, employment situation, unemployment, etc.), level of education, health, crime, services supplied to the population by central and local government, and more. In addition to these activities, the CBS conducts the Census of Population and Housing usually once every decade), as well as periodical surveys and other operations (which are conducted once every few years, such as the Family Expenditure Survey, Input-Output Tables, revisions of classifications, etc.) and one- time surveys.\n\nThese operations provide detailed data (geographical, industrial, etc.) on central phenomena in the economy and in society, that also serve as a basis for updating the statistical system."

Every year the Prime Minister provides the Parliament with a detailed report on ISTAT activities.\n\nISTAT President is bound to answer the observations and remarks  of  the Commission for the protection of  Statistical Information. the Commission supervises the impartiality and completeness of statistical information, the quality of methodologies, the compliance of surveys with EU and international directives and is established within the Presidency of the Council of Ministers.\n\nThe production of adequate public statistical information needs independence from political influences and from pressure of organised interests, clear aims, strict methodology, and full awareness of the citizens' needs and rights. To carry out these principles, the legislative decree n.322/89 has established within the Office of the Premier a Commission for guaranteeing statistical information.\n\nThe Commission supervises the information's impartiality and completeness, the quality of statistical methodologies and information technology systems used to collect, store and spread data, and the compliance of the surveys with the directives of EC bodies and international organizations. The nine members of the Commission, who are appointed every six years and for only one mandate, are designated with the President of the Republic's decree following the Prime Minister's proposal. The Commission meets at least twice a year and draws up a yearly report, which is attached to the Prime Minister's report about Istat's activities and then presented to the Parliament. As the authority guaranteeing for official statistics, the Commission is responsible for the truthfulness and correctness of the inquiries carried out by the National Statistical System within the National Statistical Program.",
                    "Organizational structure and finance": "The government bodies are the President and the Board which program, direct and evaluate the activities, in particular the technical-scientific ones, of the Institute and of the top management. The General Manager co-ordinates the administrative and organisational aspects of departmental activities. \n\nDepartments and offices: The Institute is composed of Departments, which are divided into one or more central Directions. The cabinet office, the international relations office and the communication office collaborate directly with the President and the Board. The office in charge of strategic evaluation and control operates independently and reports directly to the government bodies. In order to achieve its institutional aims Istat also relies on regional offices.",

The Programme defines the statistical surveys of public interest to be assigned to the National Statistical System and identifies their objectives.\n\nNational Statistical Programme defines the public interest statistical surveys assigned to the National Statistical System, and it is prepared by Istat, decided by the Committee for Directing and Co-ordinating Statistical Information subjected to the opinion of the Commission for Guaranteeing Statistical Information, and, after having consulted the authority on privacy and having received the Cipe's decision, it becomes operative trough a Prime Minister's decree.\n\nAll administrations, authorities and public bodies have to provide the data requested for the surveys indicated in the National Statistical Program (PSN). Private subjects have the same duty only for those surveys established by decree of the President of the Republic. The so-called sensitive data (religious beliefs, political opinions, health conditions) are never included in the obligation to respond.\n\nThe program refers to a period of three years, but it's updated every year. The PSN now in force, is the one decided upon for the years 2002-2004 which includes, on the whole, over one thousand works. EC provisions have a considerable impact on the program: the surveys and the processing which have to be done according to EC regulations and directives are respectively 113 and 101. In addition, 114 works are finalised to the European integration of Sistan's production at a European level. The creation of information systems represents another strategic course of the current Program: there are 151 projects tended to this aim, and 102 of them have been assigned to Istat.\n\nA significant role in preparing and monitoring the PSN is played by the Quality circles: permanent work groups which, sector by sector, involve official statistics producers and users, ensuring a more precise compliance of the surveys to the Italian society's and economic reality's needs.",

Starting from the second half of the XIX century, when the statistical function belonged to the Ministry of Agriculture at first and then subsequently to other ministries, official statistics offered instruments to verify important aspects of the country's life. And Istat was constituted to systematize and collect information into a coherent context.\n\nRight from the beginning, the Institute appears as an instrument of democracy. The constant publication of the Monthly Bulletin of Statistics gives all citizens access to the main data on the nation's activity. As new information is requested in time, the Institute responds readily. There are many stages in its way to knowledge. One for all: the sample survey concerning the labour forces which, after several local trials and its start on a national scale in 1957, still represents today the main instrument of control for the job market, and it's able to show inequalities and discomfort areas."

This system is generally advantageous because it enables quick responses to specific statistical requirements. On the other hand, under a decentralized system, it is generally difficult to maintain consistency in statistical activities among different ministries, and also to avoid duplication in the compilation of statistics. Therefore, it is vital that one organization coordinates the Government's statistical activities.

The DoS began its field and office work with a humble number of employees. During that period, basic statistical data covering the socio \u2013 economic aspects in the Kingdom had been produced. One of the most remarkable statistical activities conducted by the DoS was the first Housing Units Census in 1952, then the National Accounts Estimates in addition to the Statistical Yearbook.\n\n \n\nWhile in the Sixties, the DoS conducted the first Population and Housing Units Census in 1961, in addition to the first Multi-Purpose Households Survey. It also issued many publications for the first time such as the Agricultural Statistics and the External Trade Bulletins. It also carried out the Households Expenditure Survey and constructed the Consumer Price Indices. The collected data were used to formulate the seven years socio\u2013economic development program in Jordan (1964\u20131971).\n\n \n\nIn the seventies,  the DoS focused its efforts on carrying out agricultural, industrial, labour forces, population and housing units censuses in addition to sample surveys which covered households, demographic, social and economic topics. The DoS also implemented  the National Fertility Survey for the first time.\n\n \n\nThe decade of the eighties witnessed the comprehensive coverage policy of the economic phenomena by conducting various Agricultural Surveys, the Disabled Survey, the Internal Migration and Returnees Survey. This decade  was characterized by improving various economic statistics in accordance with the rules, standards and recommendations issued by the UN and other international organizations. New surveys were also added to the DoS activities such as the Constructions, Services and Commercial Establishments  Survey.\n\n \n\nThe last decade of the previous century witnessed a big leap in information technology to facilitate the process of extracting the statistical data and employing it in policy making, decision taking and  carrying out specialized studies in various fields.  During the same period, extensive efforts were made in forging links of cooperation and coordination with all national institutions which collect and use statistical data. It allowed to save time, efforts, and money. The DoS also assigned special importance on the process of statistical analysis since it believes in the futility of mere abstract figures. \n\n \n\nDuring the first years of this millennium, the DoS has focused its efforts on enhancement of statistical capacity, including the infrastructures and human resources. It assigned special importance on enhancing statistical awareness among the public which is positively reflected on the quality of statistical products. It also worked on strengthening contacts with data users through employing all available means of communications for maintaining links of trust with them.\n"

                    "Brief history and other relevant background information": "OVERVIEW OF INDIAN STATISTICAL SYSTEM\nThe Indian Statistical System functions within the overall administrative set up of the country.  India has a federal structure of Government.  The division of responsibility for administration between the Union Government and the State Governments is on the basis of three-fold classification of all subjects, namely,  the Union List, the State List,  and the Concurrent List.  The last category represents the areas where both the Union and State Governments can operate.  The subject Statistics is in this list, but conduct of surveys is in the Union List.  There is a further division of responsibility, by subjects or groups of subjects, among the different Ministries/Departments of the Union Government and among the Departments of State Governments, respectively, on the basis of their administrative functions.\n\nIn accordance with this structure, the Indian Statistical System is both decentralised and centralised. Large-scale statistical operations such as Population Census, Economic Census, Agricultural Census and Livestock Census and nation-wide sample surveys including the Annual Survey of Industries and the Socio-Economic surveys, as well as, compilation of macro-economic aggregates like national accounts, price indices and industrial production, are largely Central activities. The State Governments and statistical organisations of the States also collect and generate data on a number of variables.  \n\nThe Central Government acts as the coordinating agency for presentation of statistics on an all-India basis even in fields where the States have the primary authority and responsibility for collection of statistics.  The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation  is the nodal agency for all statistical activities at all-India level.  The State Directorates of Economics and Statistics (DESs) carry out the responsibility of coordination of all statistical activities at the State level and keeping liaison with the MOSPI for the purpose of coordination at all-India level.\n\nEVOLUTION OF MOSPI\nThe Central Statistical Organisation (CSO), which was initially set up as a Statistical Unit in the Cabinet Secretariat in 1949, became an independent organization in 1951.  Subsequently, the National Sample Survey was set up as a fact-finding body in 1950.  In 1961, a full-fledged Department of Statistics was created covering the CSO and the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO).   The Computer Centre providing common service electronic data processing facilities was set up as an attached office of the Department of Statistics in 1966.  In 1973, the Department of Statistics was transferred to the Ministry of Planning, to ensure effective coordination between planning and statistical activities.  In February, 1999, the Department of Statistics and the Department of Programme Implementation were merged to form the Department of Statistics and Programme Implementation and in October, 1999, the Department of Statistics and Programme Implementation became the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation.\n\nThe Ministry has two wings, one relating to Statistics and the other is Programme Implementation. The Statistics Wing consists of the Central Statistical Organisation (CSO), the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) and the Computer Centre. The Programme Implementation Wing has four Divisions, namely, (i) Twenty Point Programme Division, (ii) Infrastructure Monitoring Division, (iii) Project Monitoring Division and (iv) Member of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme Division.The Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), which is a premier statistical institute, receives budgetary support from the MOSPI.\n\nThe Government of India Resolution of 1st June 2005 proposes to set up a Statutory Commission, namely, the National Statistical Commission (NSC) consisting of a part-time Chairperson, four part-time Members, one each from the fields (a) economic statistics; (b) social and environment statistics; (c) censuses and surveys; and (d) national accounts and state statistical systems, and Secretary, Planning Commission as Members.  The Chief Statistician of India would serve as Secretary to the NSC.\n\nAlongwith the establishment of the NSC, the CSO and the NSSO will be merged into the National Statistical Organisation (NSO), to be headed by the Chief Statistician of India (CSI).  The NSO will have two wings, namely, (i) Central Statistics Office (CSO) and (ii) National Sample Survey Office (NSSO)."

The main Statistics Act under which data is collected by the MOSPI is the \u2018Collection of Statistics Act \u20181953.  The other most important Act for collection of statistics on demographic aspects of population is the \u2018Population Census Act 1948\u2019, which is administered by the Office of the Registral Genral of India, functioning  under the Ministry of Home Affairs.  Besides these two important Acts, there are a number of Acts, Rules and Procedures being administered by various administrative  agencies on their subjects, through which statutory returns are collected  by these Ministries/Departments. \n\nCollection of Statistics Act 1953\nThe Collection of Statistics Act 1953 empowers the Centre as well as State Governments to collect statistics in regard to any matter concerning industry or class of industries, commercial trading and industrial concerns including factories and matters relating to welfare of labour and condition of labour.  The MOSPI collects data on manufacturing establishments through the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI), using the Provisions of this Act.  \n\nThis Act specifies that the Central and State Government may appoint a statistical Authority, who in turn, may serve, on the owner of an industrial or a commercial concern or an individual, a notice requiring him/her to furnish certain  listed information about the industrial unit.  It confers the right   of access to relevant records or documents and restricts publication of any information  disclosing the identity of the industrial unit.  It also provides for certain penalties for willfully refusing  to furnish, or , the furnishing of false information.  \n\nCensus Act, 1948 \nThe Population Census, which is a Union subject, is conducted under the Census Act, 1948.  The Act empowers the Central Government to take a Population Census of the country after duly notifying its intention to do so.  It empowers the Central Government to appoint Census Commissioner and State Governments Census officers to take the census.  The Census Act is utilized for fixing primary administrative responsibility, for obtaining necessary funds, for determining the general scope and timing of the Census, for placing a legal obligation upon the people to give truthful answers, and for placing a legal obligation upon the enumerator to record the responses faithfully.  While the Act makes it obligatory for the public to answer all questions faithfully, simultaneously, it guarantees confidentiality of information in respect of individuals.  It provides penalties for (a) census officers if they fail in their official work and (b) the respondents if they provide wrong information.  The Act has been further amended vide the Census (Amendment) Act 1993."

Registration of birth, death,\nmarriage and divorce by the Department required the establishment of an organization responsible for\ncollection of information on the country's population. This led to the approval of a regulation in 1924, the\ndepartment responsible for statistics and its duties was determined and responsibility for collection and\ncentralization of necessary statistics was entrusted to the Ministry of the Interior.\nIn June 1939, the first census law was approved by National Council Parliament. Based on the law, put\ninto effect from March 1940, the population census was taken only in Tehran, and in 1940 and 1941, 33\ncities were gradually enumerated. In March 1952, Cooperation Organization of Public Statistics was\nestablished. Statistics and census law was approved in April 1958. In that year, Department of Statistics\nand Census detached from the General Department of Statistics and Civil Registration and joined the\nCooperation Organization of Public Statistics. Thus, for the first time, an organization, exclusively\nresponsible for collection of statistics, was established and was renamed Department of Public Statistics\naffiliated to the Ministry of the Interior in 1956.\nThe Department implemented the first national census of population and housing in 1956.

                    "Position in the government": "The President of the National Institute of Statistics, chosen from among the professors of statistics, economics and related subjects, shall be appointed, in accordance with Law No. 400 of 23 August 1988, by Decree of the President of the Republic on a proposal from the Prime Minister following a resolution of the Council of Ministers.  Every year the Prime Minister provides the Parliament with a detailed report on ISTAT activities.\n\nISTAT President is bound to answer the observations and remarks  of  the Commission for the protection of  Statistical Information. the Commission supervises the impartiality and completeness of statistical information, the quality of methodologies, the compliance of surveys with EU and international directives and is established within the Presidency of the Council of Ministers.\n\nThe production of adequate public statistical information needs independence from political influences and from pressure of organised interests, clear aims, strict methodology, and full awareness of the citizens' needs and rights. To carry out these principles, the legislative decree n.322/89 has established within the Office of the Premier a Commission for guaranteeing statistical information.\n\nThe Commission supervises the information's impartiality and completeness, the quality of statistical methodologies and information technology systems used to collect, store and spread data, and the compliance of the surveys with the directives of EC bodies and international organizations. The nine members of the Commission, who are appointed every six years and for only one mandate, are designated with the President of the Republic's decree following the Prime Minister's proposal. The Commission meets at least twice a year and draws up a yearly report, which is attached to the Prime Minister's report about Istat's activities and then presented to the Parliament. As the authority guaranteeing for official statistics, the Commission is responsible for the truthfulness and correctness of the inquiries carried out by the National Statistical System within the National Statistical Program.",
                    "Organizational structure and finance": "The government bodies are the President and the Board which program, direct and evaluate the activities, in particular the technical-scientific ones, of the Institute and of the top management. The General Manager co-ordinates the administrative and organisational aspects of departmental activities. \n\nDepartments and offices: The Institute is composed of Departments, which are divided into one or more central Directions. The cabinet office, the international relations office and the communication office collaborate directly with the President and the Board. The office in charge of strategic evaluation and control operates independently and reports directly to the government bodies. In order to achieve its institutional aims Istat also relies on regional offices.",
                    "Multi-annual or annual work program": "The National Statistical Programme (NSP) is a three-year programme that is annually updated.Drawn up by Istat upon decision of the Committee for Directing and Co-ordinating Statistical Information; supervised by the Commission for Guaranteeing Statistical Information and Authority for Privacy; comes into force with a Prime Minister's Decree. The Programme defines the statistical surveys of public interest to be assigned to the National Statistical System and identifies their objectives.\n\nNational Statistical Programme defines the public interest statistical surveys assigned to the National Statistical System, and it is prepared by Istat, decided by the Committee for Directing and Co-ordinating Statistical Information subjected to the opinion of the Commission for Guaranteeing Statistical Information, and, after having consulted the authority on privacy and having received the Cipe's decision, it becomes operative trough a Prime Minister's decree.\n\nAll administrations, authorities and public bodies have to provide the data requested for the surveys indicated in the National Statistical Program (PSN). Private subjects have the same duty only for those surveys established by decree of the President of the Republic. The so-called sensitive data (religious beliefs, political opinions, health conditions) are never included in the obligation to respond.\n\nThe program refers to a period of three years, but it's updated every year. The PSN now in force, is the one decided upon for the years 2002-2004 which includes, on the whole, over one thousand works. EC provisions have a considerable impact on the program: the surveys and the processing which have to be done according to EC regulations and directives are respectively 113 and 101. In addition, 114 works are finalised to the European integration of Sistan's production at a European level. The creation of information systems represents another strategic course of the current Program: there are 151 projects tended to this aim, and 102 of them have been assigned to Istat.\n\nA significant role in preparing and monitoring the PSN is played by the Quality circles: permanent work groups which, sector by sector, involve official statistics producers and users, ensuring a more precise compliance of the surveys to the Italian society's and economic reality's needs.",
                    "Main duties": "Today the Institute represents a part, the most substantial, of the big National Statistical System (Sistan) network which has the task of producing and spreading official statistics to the country and to international organizations."

Starting from the second half of the XIX century, when the statistical function belonged to the Ministry of Agriculture at first and then subsequently to other ministries, official statistics offered instruments to verify important aspects of the country's life. And Istat was constituted to systematize and collect information into a coherent context.\n\nRight from the beginning, the Institute appears as an instrument of democracy. The constant publication of the Monthly Bulletin of Statistics gives all citizens access to the main data on the nation's activity. As new information is requested in time, the Institute responds readily. There are many stages in its way to knowledge. One for all: the sample survey concerning the labour forces which, after several local trials and its start on a national scale in 1957, still represents today the main instrument of control for the job market, and it's able to show inequalities and discomfort areas."

This system is generally advantageous because it enables quick responses to specific statistical requirements. On the other hand, under a decentralized system, it is generally difficult to maintain consistency in statistical activities among different ministries, and also to avoid duplication in the compilation of statistics. Therefore, it is vital that one organization coordinates the Government's statistical activities.

The DoS began its field and office work with a humble number of employees. During that period, basic statistical data covering the socio \u2013 economic aspects in the Kingdom had been produced. One of the most remarkable statistical activities conducted by the DoS was the first Housing Units Census in 1952, then the National Accounts Estimates in addition to the Statistical Yearbook.\n\n \n\nWhile in the Sixties, the DoS conducted the first Population and Housing Units Census in 1961, in addition to the first Multi-Purpose Households Survey. It also issued many publications for the first time such as the Agricultural Statistics and the External Trade Bulletins. It also carried out the Households Expenditure Survey and constructed the Consumer Price Indices. The collected data were used to formulate the seven years socio\u2013economic development program in Jordan (1964\u20131971).\n\n \n\nIn the seventies,  the DoS focused its efforts on carrying out agricultural, industrial, labour forces, population and housing units censuses in addition to sample surveys which covered households, demographic, social and economic topics. The DoS also implemented  the National Fertility Survey for the first time.\n\n \n\nThe decade of the eighties witnessed the comprehensive coverage policy of the economic phenomena by conducting various Agricultural Surveys, the Disabled Survey, the Internal Migration and Returnees Survey. This decade  was characterized by improving various economic statistics in accordance with the rules, standards and recommendations issued by the UN and other international organizations. New surveys were also added to the DoS activities such as the Constructions, Services and Commercial Establishments  Survey.\n\n \n\nThe last decade of the previous century witnessed a big leap in information technology to facilitate the process of extracting the statistical data and employing it in policy making, decision taking and  carrying out specialized studies in various fields.  During the same period, extensive efforts were made in forging links of cooperation and coordination with all national institutions which collect and use statistical data. It allowed to save time, efforts, and money. The DoS also assigned special importance on the process of statistical analysis since it believes in the futility of mere abstract figures. \n\n \n\nDuring the first years of this millennium, the DoS has focused its efforts on enhancement of statistical capacity, including the infrastructures and human resources. It assigned special importance on enhancing statistical awareness among the public which is positively reflected on the quality of statistical products. It also worked on strengthening contacts with data users through employing all available means of communications for maintaining links of trust with them.\n"

                    "Brief history and other relevant background information": "The little available information indicates that Bureau of Statistics (BOS) grew out of a statistical unit of the Ministry of Agriculture around 1964. However, there is an indication that statistical activities in the fields of agriculture and population started long before the birth of the BOS. Lesotho has had decennial censuses of agriculture from 1949 and regular population censuses as far back as 1875. Activities in general statistics surfaced in 1965 when the statistics act of 1965 was passed. This act provides for collection, analysis and dissemination of statistical data and does not make provision for the coordination of statistical activities. It has, however, been informally accepted that BOS is performing that role even without the legal backing. Since that time plans were then afoot to provide that legal backing.\n\nIn 1982, the structure of the BOS included a deputy director who, besides heading the field operation division, oversaw the division and was responsible to the director of statistics. The substantive divisions then were: Trade and Economic statistics, Demography and Social statistics, Data processing. Later on changes were made to accommodate a division responsible for field operation and support services. The position of Deputy Director was re-designated Chief Statistician responsible for the new division of Agricultural Statistics \n\nRegarding personnel, the available information reveal that at the formation of the Bureau of Statistics there was one Director and two Statisticians and in 1967, two years later, the establishment stood at one Director, one Deputy Director, three statistician and four posts of Statistical Officer of which three were filled. During this era, qualified personnel were in short supply and there was inadequate funding to achieve the staff component which would adequately carry out the statistical undertakings enumerated in the Statistics Act 1965. This act has been replaced by the new Bureau of Statistics Act of 2001.\n\nIn 1980, the Data Processing Division came into existence thus ushering in a new occupational group within the statistical service. It is worth mentioning that the group that was ushered into the statistical service did not come from outside, existing staff was retrained.\n\nBOS was recently restructured and got the structure as described above."

As such, it was often difficult to aggregate these state figures to a \"national\" figure. The governments recognized the need for single national indicators. This need was further compounded by international requests for such information.\n\nIn 1999 a memorandum of understanding (MOU) was signed by the national government and the state governments, centralizing statistical operations under the national office. The statistics offices in the 4 states are now operating under the national budget, statistics collected by these states get sent to the National Statistics Office for compilation, thus producing statistics representing both the States and National Government.\n\nThe National Statistics Office is based at the capital (Palikir) with 8 staff, while branch offices in the 4 states are manned with 3 working staff each.\n\nThe Statistics Office is presently known as the \"Statistics Unit\" within the Department of Economic Affairs.

Later in the 13th century the Mongolian Empire enumerated its population and used the result to levy taxes.\n\nThe basis of official statistics was laid out since the enforcement of Article in the First Constitution of Mongolia which was approved in 1924. The article states to establish and operationalize the statistical activities of the country. The following law the registration division comprised of 6 staff was set up under the Ministry if Internal Affairs in November 11, 1924. As the scope and number of statistical activities increased the structure of statistical system expanded and in 1964 the Central Statistical Office was formed with much wider framework of activities and responsibilities based on a more centralized reporting system.\n\nStarting from 1990 when Mongolia moved to a market economy the statistical and activities faced a challenge of undergoing fundamental reforms towards the operational ones in the newly introduced system. Particularly, from the mid of 1990s several milestone measures were taken to restructure the system in coherence with market economy conditions, adapt and implement international methodologies and principles and deliver more user oriented services. By now, Central Statistical Office was replaced by the National Statistical Office (NSO), Mongolia's official statistical agency, which is under the Parliament in accordance with the statistical law adopted in 1994 and revised in 1997. It has been conducting a number of surveys such as consumer price index survey, LSMS, HIES, RHS, Establishment Survey etc ."

There is no longer a hierarchical relationship between the Minister of Economic Affairs and the organisation. However, the minister is responsible for setting up and maintaining a system for the provision of government statistical information; in other words the minister is politically responsible for legislation and budget, for the creation of conditions for an independent and public production of high quality and reliable statistics. The costs of tasks and activities undertaken to put this legislation into practice are accountable to the government's budget.",
                    "Organizational structure and finance": "The senior management of Statistics Netherlands is assured by an Executive Board, consisting of the Director-General and the Deputy Director-General. There are three statistical divisions: Business Statistics, Social & Spatial Statistics and Macro-Economic Statistics & Dissemination. In addition there is a division for Technology and Facilities. In direct support of the Executive Board are 4 Central Departments: Policy Staff, Operational Management, Facility Services and Personnel & Organization.\n\nIn addition, Statistics Netherlands is also managed by a Central Commission for Statistics (CCS). The CCS is made up of a chairman and an even number of other members totaling no fewer than six and no more than ten. Members are appointed (or a period not exceeding four years, with the possibility of a one-time re-appointment) and dismissed by the Minister of Economic Affairs. The chairman and the other members may not also be civil servants subordinate to the Minister. The CSS has a general oversight function for official statistics in The Netherlands; its duties are among others to foster the provision of statistical information for the government which meets the needs of practice, policy and science, to assess the work programmes of Statistics Netherlands, and to draw up management regulations.",
                    "Multi-annual or annual work program": "In addition to an annual work programme, the Director-General has to submit a multi-annual work programme at least every five years, for approval by the Central Commission of Statistics.",

In addition to its responsibility for (official) national statistics, Statistics Netherlands also has the task of producing European (community) statistics. The legal basis for Statistics Netherlands and its work is the Act of 20 November 2003 governing the central bureau of statistics. The information Statistics Netherlands publishes incorporates a multitude of societal aspects, from macro-economic indicators such as economic growth and consumer prices, to the incomes of individual people and households. Statistics Netherlands' statistical programmes (the long-term statistical programme and the annual work programme) are set by the Central Commission for Statistics. This is an independent commission that watches over the independence, impartiality, relevance, quality and continuity of the statistical programme. The Director-General decides autonomously which methods to use to make these statistics, and whether or not to publish results. \n\nStatistics Netherlands aims to reduce the administrative burden for companies and the public as much as possible. To this end it uses existing administrative registrations of both government and government-funded organisations. The information from these files is supplied to Statistics Netherlands free of charge. Only if they do not contain sufficient information, Statistics Netherlands is allowed to conduct supplementary surveys among companies and private persons. Companies are usually obliged by law to supply information to Statistics Netherlands and can be forced to cooperate under certain circumstances; Statistics Netherlands may use sanctions such as administrative fines. For its part Statistics Netherlands is obliged to keep all individual data confidential. As an exception data sharing with Eurostat, NSIs in EU member states, Dutch Central Bank and academic researches is allowed under certain restructures.\n\nOn 3 January 2004, Statistics Netherlands became an autonomous agency with legal personality.

                    "Access to administrative data": "Statistics New Zealand processes administrative data from other government agencies, notably (i) passenger arrival and departure cards, (ii) birth, death and marriage registrations, and marriage dissolutions, (iii) abortions, (iv) building consents, and (v) income tax records.  It is also increasingly involved in preparing and analysing integrated datasets from a variety of sources, notably in relation to student loans and for the linking of employer and employee data.\n\nStatistics New Zealand has continued to expand the use of administrative data, particularly tax data, to supplement or substitute for existing direct surveys.  Goods and Services Tax (GST) returns to the Inland Revenue Department have been introduced as a component in the redesigned Wholesale Trade Survey, thereby reducing the number of survey respondents by over 600 each quarter (a 36% reduction).  In addition, the use of GST returns in the Quarterly Survey of Manufacturing allowed the number of businesses surveyed to be reduced by 450 (a 28% reduction).  A similar approach is planned for the re-developed Retail Trade Survey in August 2003.  With the re-design it is anticipated that there will be a substantial percentage reduction in businesses surveyed.\n\nChanges proposed for the Annual Business Frame Updating Survey in February 2004 will make use of tax data.  As a consequence, 10,000 fewer firms will be surveyed each year.  The use of tax data is expected to reduce the number of businesses surveyed for the Monthly Business Frame Update Survey by approximately 2000 per month (a 40% reduction).\n\nGood progress has been made on making use of tax data for new statistical series, notably Injury Statistics and the Linked Employer/Employee Database.",
                    "Data confidentiality": "The risk of individual data being inadvertently disclosed is very low, due to the application of strict confidentiality routines in the processing of data for publication.  However, there is provision in the Statistics Act for disclosure of individual data (without the name or address of the respondent) when such disclosure is sought in questionnaires for surveys conducted jointly by Statistics New Zealand and another government agency, and consent to disclosure is given in writing by the respondents concerned."

                    "Brief history and other relevant background information": "Prior to 1947, there was no recognised body responsible for statistical activities in Nigeria although the population census, the most important and oldest statistical exercise in Nigeria, was conducted in 1866 for the municipality of Lagos, based on the Act enacted for that purpose in 1863. Population census and external trade statistics were the first set of official statistics to be developed in Nigeria.\n\nIn 1947 however, a section of the Department of Customs and Excise was established as the nucleus of a full-fledged Department of Statistics enjoying the status of a department (unit of government service then). In 1949, the department was expanded and re-organised on a more permanent basis and a Government Statistician was appointed to head it. In 1960 when ministerial approach to government was adopted, the department was placed under the Federal Office of Statistics (FOS), enjoying the status of an extra-ministerial department. Over the years, changes in the headship of FOS has followed changes in headship of professional cadre in the Federal Civil Service - from Government Statistician in 1949 to Chief Statistician in 1960, Director of Statistics in 1976 and Co-ordinating Director of Statistics in 1984.\n\nDuring its formative years, FOS restricted its activities to administrative statistics such as external trade statistics derived from customs bills of entry. Subsequently, the scope of its activities was widened to include compilation and publication of statistics on internal migration, shipping movement at Nigerian ports, tonnage of cargo carried by rail and sea, etc. In addition, it conducted a number of enquiries into issues such as retail prices, livestock and crop production, household consumption, etc. Most of these enquiries were not based on probability samples. In some cases, only respondents who were willing to participate in an enquiry were approached for interview. The greatest achievement of FOS during this period was the conduct of the 1952/1953 population census. At the creation of the National Population Commission however, FOS ceased to handle matters relating to population census while all its sample surveys have become more rigorously designed and national in coverage.\n\nAs the functions and responsibilities of FOS became varied and enlarged, it was given a legal backing in 1958 when the Statistics Act was enacted. Apart from amendments affecting population census and penalty concerning data collection and dissemination, this Act remains the main source of responsibility of the FOS and it is still very relevant.\n\nAlso in the 1980s, the office through Decree 42 of 1988 (the civil service review) was organised into 7 departments and 3 units with a Director General. By that Decree, statistical units were supposed to be established in every government agency as a corporate body of that establishment thereby relieving the FOS the task of pooling statisticians at the FOS.\n\nThe National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) came into being with the merger of the Federal Office of Statistics (FOS) and the National Data Bank (NDB).  The creation is part of the  implementation of the Statistical Master Plan (SMP), a programme document of the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN). The document\u2019s preparation was funded by the World Bank in 2003.  The implementation is designed to span five years, 2005-2009.\n\nHitherto, the FOS, which had been the apex data producing agency of Government in Nigeria since 1947, had failed to meet its mandate of producing adequate, accurate and timely data needed for decision making.  Falling into decay in much of the 1990s, the agency\u2019s performance got to its lowest ebb between 2000 and 2003. Among the reasons for this appalling state were the  poor attention from Government, bad management, a bloated and low quality workforce, preponderance of non-professional staff (particularly administrative and accounting personnel), archaic data production and management technologies, and  low morale and productivity of workers.  \n\nAll these manifested in non-production of relevant statistics for planning and evidence-based policy formulation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation, or, at best, the production of data that were untimely and often without any iota of integrity.  This situation necessitated the current process of reforms in the NBS.\n\nThe broad objective of the reforms in the NBS is to implement the SMP and also transform the Bureau along the dictates of the ongoing Federal Government Public Service Reform Programme.  The Agency is involved in the Economic Reform and Governance Programme (ERGP) of the World Bank and the European Union\u2019s (EU\u2019s) EMCAP programme, which are both managed through the Federal Ministry of Finance. The goal of the entire reform programme for NBS is to transform the  Agency into a world class National Statistical Office (NSO), which will be able to produce adequate, high quality and timely data relevant to the demands of users in Government, the universities and research Institutes, private sector organizations and international agencies."

                    "Brief history and other relevant background information": "The Bureau of Statistics was established in 1948 in the Office of Public Information just after the establishment of the new government of Korea. At that time, the Bureau of Statistics had 4 divisions: general affairs, planning, population census and vital statistics. The Bureau of Statistics was transferred to the Ministry of Home Affairs in 1955 and its function was extended from the compilation of population statistics to the compilation of population and economic statistics. \nIn 1961, the Economic Planning Board (EPB) was established to formulate and coordinate the national economic development plan. The EPB was based on four bureaus; two from the Ministry of Construction, and one each from the Ministry of Finance and from the Ministry of Home Affairs (Bureau of Statistics). Thus the Bureau of Statistics was transferred again and put under another ministerial level organization, namely the EPB, and the name of the bureau was changed in 1962 to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBOS), the predecessor of National Statistical Office. From 1961, until the end of the 1980's, the NBOS contributed to the foundation of national economic development plans by producing fundamental statistics and coordinating the national statistical services. \nIn December of 1990, due to the increasing importance of national statistical services with the growth of the economic strength in the 1980's, the NBOS was enlarged and upgraded and the name was changed to the Korea National Statistical Office (hereafter referred to as the KOSTAT), an assistant ministerial level organization. Since the governmental reorganization in 1994, the KOSTAT has been within the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance and Economy which comprises the EPB and the Ministry of Finance. \nIn 1995, according to the rapid change of internal and external situations, the KOSTAT set up a Statistical Information Division and an International Statistics Division. \nIn 1998, the Statistical Survey Bureau was divided into the Economic Statistics Bureau and the Population & Social Statistics Bureau, and the KOSTAT established the Agriculture & Fishery Statistics Division with reception of agricultural and fishery statistics from the Ministry of Agricultural and Forestry and the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries. Additionally, the KOSTAT founded 26 sub-local offices. \nIn 1999, the Statistical Training Center and the Division of Statistical Development in the Bureau of Statistical Planning was abolished. The Division of Statistical Research was renamed as the Division of Statistical Development and transferred to the Bureau of Statistical Planning. The Division of Service Industry Statistics was newly established within the Bureau of Economic Statistics, and the Division of Trade & Price Statistics was renamed as the Division of Price Statistics (4 bureaus, 19 divisions, 12 local statistics offices and 35 sub-local branch offices).\nIn 2000, the KOSTAT was able to appoint a Director-General of Statistical Information Service Bureau on contract and designated Chungnam Statistics Office as the organization in charge of operation.\nIn 2002, the KOSTAT transferred the production of fishery statistics to the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries.\nIn 2004, the Statistical Research & Development Division (15 officials) was newly established within the Statistical Planning Bureau, and the International Statistics Division was renamed the International Statistical Cooperation Division (4 bureaus, 20 divisions, 12 local statistics offices and 35 sub-local branch offices). The Reform & Personnel Division was newly established within the Statistical Planning Bureau and the Planning Division was abolished.\nIn 2005, the Statistical Training Institute was newly set up aiming at training KOSTAT personnel on innovation works and nurturing statistical experts. The Statistical Training Institute consisted of the Training Planning Division and the Training Management Division. The KOSTAT reinforced the functions related to statistical policies, statistical geographic information and supported the development of regional statistics for the purpose of reinforcing national statistical infrastructure and reforming statistical activities. The KOSTAT had 1 training institute (2 divisions), 12 local statistics offices and 35 sub-local branch offices). \nIn 2005, The KOSTAT was also upgraded to the Deputy Ministerial level. The 4th graded local branch offices were renamed the Local Statistics Offices with a view to continuing innovation works of national statistics and reinforcing the functions such as mid-term financial planning, coordination & quality management of national statistics, as well as support of regional statistics. The KOSTAT had 1 office, 4 bureaus, 3 officers, 20 divisions, 3 teams and 1 unit in the headquarters. And the KOSTAT had 1 training institute (2 divisions), 12 local statistics offices and 35 sub-local branch offices.\nIn 2006, The KOSTAT founded the Statistics Research Institute to develop and supply new statistics, and established the Audit & Inspection Officer to reinforce auditing function. And the KOSTAT introduced the high-ranking official pool.\nIn 2008, the production work of agriculture and fishery statistics was transferred to KOSTAT from the Ministry of Agriculture & Forestry and the Ministry of Maritime Affairs & Fisheries according to the revision of \u201cGovernment Organization Act.\u201d\nAs of 2009, KOSTAT is consist of 6 bureaus, 4 offices, 23 divisions and 7 teams in the headquarter while operating the Statistical Training Institute (STI), Statistical Research Institute (SRI) and 5 local offices and 49 local branch offices."

During the process of its realization the basis for creation of national statistical system were established, a system that corresponds to the status of an independent state. \nDuring this period a series of measurements were fulfilled, thus putting the basis for transition to the United Nations\u2019 System of National Accounts (SNA), to elaboration of inter-branch balances, reformation of financial system. New statistical fields were created: external trade, registers and classifiers, enterprise statistics, price and gender statistics.  \nIn 1999 the \u201eReformation Concept of national statistical system in years 1999-2002\u201d was developed and approved by Government.\nFor the purpose of accomplishing the Concept, the process of linkaging the national statistical system to international standards has continued, taking into account country\u2019s peculiarities. For this reason important works were executed regarding the improvement of the system of statistical indicators, their computation methodology, testing and implementation of new data collection and calculation methods based on sample surveys: household budget survey, price survey, annual survey of big and small enterprises, private sector in agriculture, labour force survey, different sociological surveys. \nIn order to facilitate the access to statistical data and a better informatization of internal and external users in different areas, the Web page of the Department of Statistics was launched in year 2002; starting with year 2002 the Statistical Yearbook of Republic of Moldova is also developed on CD Rom. \nIn March 2003 the statistical library was opened, giving the possibility to consult own statistical publications as well as those that come from different statistical bodies from other countries, and from international organizations. \nIn 2004 the population census was conducted according to UN recommendations, the first national census after the proclamation of independence of Republic of Moldova. \nAt the end of year 2004 the new Act \u201con official statistics\u201d (no. 412-XV from December 9, 2004) was approved, thus making the fundamental basis for reformation of national statistics and its connection to international legislative standards respecting statistical principles, such as: impartiality, statistical deontology, relevance, transparency, confidentiality, cost-efficiency principle, coordination at national level and collaboration at international level. \nNowadays, the activity of NBS is carried out in accordance with the medium-term Program (2004-2006) \u201ePriority directions and Action Plan for development of national statistics\u201d.\nOn 2nd May 2006, Moldova became the 63rd member state (subscribed to IMF\u2019 Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS)."

Since 1824 cattle has been included in statistical surveys as well. Since 1834, regular censuses have been carried out every five years. Since 1843, statistical data on external trade, domestic turnover, prices and wages have been compiled.\n     Statistical work was done even before the foundation of the national Statistical Office. There were international congresses of statisticians held in the Hague in 1859, in Berlin in 1863 and Florence in 1867, and they were attended by Serbian statisticians as well.\n     In 1881 the Law on the Organization of Statistics was enacted. In 1882, the Ministry of National Economy assumed responsibility regarding national statistics.\n     The Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia has been a member of the International Statistical Institute since its foundation.\n     The first \"State Statistics\" of Serbia was printed in 1863.\n     The results of population census were published in 1863.\n     The first Statistical Yearbook of the Kingdom of Serbia was published in 1893.\n     In 1894 the \"State Statistics\" was published for the last time.\n     The last Statistical Yearbook of the Kingdom of Serbia was published in 1910. In 1954 a special edition of the Statistical Yearbook of Serbia was re-published.\n     The State Statistics Directorate was founded in 1919 in the scope of the Ministry of Social Policy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, but a special Statistical Office of Serbia was opened only in 1945.\n     The Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia was founded in 1945. \n"

                    "Brief history and other relevant background information": "July 12, 1859 - The ruler Alexandru Ioan Cuza signed The Ordinance on the setting up on Central Administrative Statistics Office, marking the birth certificate of official statistics in Romania. This moment is also related to the names of two famous Romanian economists of the XIX-th century, Dionisie Pop Martian and Ion Ionescu de la Brad.\n\nIn the long run, official statistics, one of the first public institutions created in Romania after the Union as well as one of oldest statistical offices in Europe has faced evolutions and reorganizations, successively changing its name, always observing the principles of truth and probity of its approach, keeping its status of main instrument of knowledge and evaluation of the country reality, providing, through statistical data and information, the necessary background to the authorities, to economic units, to the whole society, to build up and put into practice some realistic programs of governing, of economic and social development.\n\n\nI. Start and confirmation (1859-1877)\n\nSince the beginning, without having the necessary material resources, sufficient and specialized staff, the statistical institution ventured and succeeded to end far-reaching actions, gaining fame and prestige. The following were achieved:\n\no Population Census (1859-1860) \n\no Industrial Establishment Census (1863), the first national survey of an European Country \n\no \"Statistical and Economic Annals (1860)\" \n\no Romania was among the most active participants in international statistical congresses in London, Berlin, Florence and Hague \n\nII. Contributions to economic and social consolidation of Romania after conquering the state independence (1877-1914).\n\nCarrying on the steps of the pioneer period, official statistics is one of the main pillars of the Romanian state in the period of its consolidation, through a substantial contribution of statistical information necessary to take accurate decisions for the country development. The following were achieved:\n\no Population Census of 1899 and 1912 \n\no Publication System was enriched with the following series:\n\nRomanian Statistical Bulletin (1892)\nDemographic Review (1892)\nStatistical Yearbook of Romania (1909) \n\no Higher statistical education was created, through the Academy of High Commercial and Social Studies (1913) \n\nIII. Romanian statistical school in vanguard of international statistics (1918-1945)\n\nBetween the two world wars, Romanian official statistics imposes itself, through its great personalities, the status of a prestige school at international level. It is the period when the institution takes advantage from the creative activity of famous personalities: Dimitrie Gusti, Octav Onicescu, Grigore Moisil, Gheorghe Mihoc, Sabin Manuila, Anton Golopentia etc.\n\nReference points:\n\no Romanian Agriculture Atlas (1929) \n\no General Population Census of Romania (1930) \n\no General Census of Romania (1941), in which the main place was held by the inventory of industrial enterprises \n\no Agriculture Census (1941), the first systematic paper of this type carried out in our country \n\no Extension of selective samples for almost all fields of national economy \n\no Setting up the Statistical School (1930) which became Statistical Institute of Bucharest University (1941) \n\nIV. Keeping the identity and professional probity (1946-1989)\n\nThe years after the second world war, a period full of obstacles and difficulties, of all kinds of pressure, are however characterized by the efforts made by a new generation of statisticians - most of them were ex-collaborators and disciples of previous period masters - to assure the continuity of statistical data and series and to keep at great extent the credibility of Romanian official statistics, in spite of totalitarian regime, of convenient and make up presentation of some statistical information. Among the efforts made to keep the identity of statistical science and of professional probity of its civil servants, it is well known the contribution of Mihail Levente and Mircea Biji, of other remarkable specialists for the following:\n\no Carrying out very complex statistical papers\n\nPopulation and Housing Census (1966 and 1977) \nThe first balance of economic branches connection \n\no Passing to data electronic processing \n\no Beginning the collaboration with UN Statistical Direction\n\nV. For a functional market economy, serving the state of right and democratic values of Romanian society\n\nThe new history of statistics is related to the end of 1989. After December 1989, Romanian statistics regained the virtues of a modern statistics, complying with the international norms and standards, aiming at obtaining comparable statistical data. The preponderantly exhaustive surveys carried out during the years previous to the Revolution were mostly replaced with sample surveys, which imply a special scientific rigor on the information producer side, wider specific knowledge on the statistician side and, at the same time, a statistical culture of information user and provider, in view to perceive their values and to use them in their undertakings.\nSince that moment, a lot of difficulties and a lot of challenges were faced.\nIf one would like to make an inventory of various milestones of statistical starting with 1990, this should include the following:\n\uf0d8\t1992: Government Ordinance on official statistics functioning (subsequently approved by Law in 1994);\n\uf0d8\t1992: Common Declaration between Eurostat and 7 countries in transition (among which, Romania);\n\uf0d8\t1994: bilateral Common Declaration between Eurostat & INS/Romania;\n\uf0d8\t1996: the reply to the first questionnaire from the to Ministry of the Europe Integration (a detailed self assessment of the Romanian statistics);\n\uf0d8\t1998 & 1999: two screening exercises took place one multicountry and one bilateral with the European Commission experts;\n\uf0d8\t2000: chapter 12 of  negotiation on statistics in the acquis communautaire, meaning that Romania complied with EU norms and standards, without requesting any derogations or transition periods;\n\uf0d8\tyears of Phare Programs (National & Multicountry) assisting the Romanian statistics development resulted in progresses towards the sustainability of the system;\n\uf0d8\tyears of being observers in the working parties, task forces, seminars, conferences in Eurostat, through which we learnt a lot not only from Eurostat, but also from our colleagues from EU Member States.\nNowadays, the Romanian statistics is integrated in the decision making process and deeply involved at the international and European level. As an arch over time and over cooperation matters dealt by INS/Romania, since 2006 the institute turns to give technical assistance to other countries needing this, such as: Turkey, Georgia, Armenia, Ukraine."

Russian statistical system was re-established in 1921 when the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was created. Until 1990, the statistical work of the statistical service of Russia was carried out under the direct guidance of the USSR Central Statistics Board. Since 1990, the State Committee on Statistics has been an independent government agency under the supervision of the Government, bearing full responsibility for the organization of statistical work in the country.

Since then, censuses have been taken regularly at ten-year intervals. The Census Ordinance of 1880 constituted the first statistical legislation for Singapore.\n\nA legal framework for the collection, preparation and publication of official statistics was put in place only in 1921 with the enactment of the Statistics Ordinance. The Statistics Ordinance provided for the establishment of a Statistical Bureau. The Bureau has developed and grown to become the Singapore Department of Statistics today.\n\nThe Singapore Department of Statistics is the national statistical office  responsible for official statistics on the Singapore economy and population. Before Singapore achieved self-government in 1959, the Department compiled almost all the statistical series. The focus was on external trade, shipping and cargo statistics and basic demographic data. The statistical activities expanded rapidly in the 1960s to cover manufacturing, and service statistics.\n\nSince 1973, a decentralised statistical system has been adopted. Official statistics are collected and compiled by the Singapore Department of Statistics as well as Research and Statistics Units (RSUs) in various government ministries and statutory boards. The RSUs specialise in statistics on key areas under the purview of their parent organisations."

On the base of this Act, legal subjectivity of regional offices (with seat in Bratislava, Trnava, Nitra, Tren\u010d\u00edn, \u017dilina, Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica, Ko\u0161ice and in Pre\u0161ov, which took part in fulfilling the tasks of the SO SR in the fields by relevant specialization for the whole territory of the Slovak Republic in 1996 - 2001) was cancelled from 1 January 2002 and regional offices became directly a part of the Office as its internal organizational units. The Act created a space for strengthening stability and independence of the Office by enacting appointment and recalling of the President of the Office by the President of the SR on a proposal of the Slovak Government with the term of office for five years (with a possibility to re-appoint the same person only for two consequent terms of office).\n\nThe legislative intent of the act on 2011 population and housing census has laid the foundation for creation of wide source of information necessary for prognosis of the trends in demography and for decision-making in social policy of the state. Great progress was made in dissemination and provision of information by putting the new internet portal into operation and by on-line database of regional statistics. The Office, as an integral part of the European Statistical System, has actively participated on initiatives towards the system development, creation of statistical legislation, introduction of new statistical procedures and methods, and increase of comparability and quality of statistical data. The development of the management quality system has continued, as well as implementation of the Code of Practice into all fields. The team of the experts of the European Statistical System has stated, after the examination of implementation, that the SOSR is the professional and well performing institution.\n"
