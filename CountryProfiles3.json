The statistics section was part of the former Department of Commerce and Industries. The census section comprised the Census Department which was created on December 1,1944 for the purpose of taking the Census of Population in 1946.\n\nBoth these units had been under the control of the Ministry of Labour, Industry and Commerce. With the inauguration of the Soulbury Constitution they were brought under a new department namely the Department of Census, Statistics and Planning which was assigned under the Ministry of Home Affairs, through a gazette notification dated September 29,1947. This department was renamed as the Department of Census and Statistics and assigned to the Ministry of Finance by the gazette notification dated May 18,1948. \n\nThe DCS continued to function under the Ministry of Finance till 1970 and thereafter under the Ministry of Planning and Employment until 1977. Since 1977, it was functioning under the Ministry of Policy Planning and Implementation and from 1994 under the Ministry of Finance, Planning, Ethnic affairs and National Integration and thus came under the purview of the President. Then again for a short period, the DCS was functioning under the Ministry of Plan Implementation and was transferred back to the Ministry of Finance and Planning. DCS was functioning under the newly created Ministry of Interior since the beginning of the year 2002. Since 2004, DCS has been functioning under the Ministry of Finance and Planning."

                    "Legal basis": "There are two ordinances namely Census Ordinance and Statistics Ordinance under which the DCS collects data through censuses and surveys. They were established in order to secure the reliability and thereby the usefulness of statistics by ensuring the protection of the privacy of the respondents. These ordinances stipulate that statistics which are highly important for policy planning and decision making of the government should be collected by the DCS.\n\nCensus Ordinance.\nThe first legal sanction in Sri Lanka provided under the Census Ordinance was framed in 1868 on the lines of the English law for the conduct of the first Census in 1871. This ordinance was amended in 1880 and repealed in 1900. A new ordinance was drafted thereafter on the lines of the Indian Census Act and was passed by the legislature. The new ordinance include provisions to make the census taking procedure more flexible, the right to have access and to make any marks or numbers to any land, building, vessel or any other place by the census officer for the Purpose of census taking. In the new ordinance the census officer was declared to be a public servant within the meaning of the penal code and the officer in charge of each administrative district was given legal status as Census Commissioner of his district. Legal sanction was also given under the new ordinance for census officers to ask questions relating to census schedule and the respondents were required to answer to the best of their knowledge and belief. Breach of\ncensus rules, abuse of power by a census officer, obstructing an officer in carrying out his duties and similar acts and omissions were made punishable. The Census Ordinance of 1900 substantially remained the basis for census taking in Sri Lanka throughout the years, with minor amendments in 1945, 1955,1980 and 2000, and it covers not only the Census of Population and Housing but also Censuses of Agriculture Industry, Commerce etc. The amendments made in!980 include the provision of legal sanctity for the confidentiality of the information collected at the census. Thus the Census Ordinance\ncasts an obligation on the part of the respondents to answer all questions asked at a census, and at the same time it safeguards the respondents by causing any information collected at a census, to be inadmissible as evidence in a court of law. The amendments made in 2000 include some changes to suit the present administrative set up in the country and also to increase the penalty. \nStatistics Ordinance.\nThe Statistics Ordinance, which was enacted in 1935, provides for the establishment of an official Bureau of Statistics and for the supply of information thereto. This ordinance was amended in 1955. The Statistics Ordinance provided legal sanction for the Director of Statistics to collect statistical information relating to the socio-economic conditions of the country. There is provision in this ordinance like in the Census Ordinance to safeguard the confidentiality of the information provided by the respondent. The ordinance also prevent the disclosure or arrangement of data, to facilitate the identification of any particulars as being particulars relating to any individual person or business, in any report, summary of statistics or other publications prepared based on the data collected under the Statistics Ordinance."

                    "Brief history and other relevant background information": "The groundwork for Swedish population statistics was laid by the Church Ordinance of 1686, which required registration of all citizens living in the parishes.\n\nIn 1749 the concept of the \u201cCollection of Tables\u201d (Tabellverket) was introduced, marking the start of regular compilation of population statistics, which was quite a unique phenomenon. Sweden - and Finland, which was then under Swedish rule - are the only countries that possess continuous records of their population so far back in time. \n\nInitially, the responsibility for the Collection of Tables rested on one clerk who worked in one of the standing committees of the Swedish Parliament. It was not until 1756 that a separate public agency, the \u201cTables Commission\u201d (Tabellkommissionen) was established. Its task was to ensure that the collection of tables ran smoothly.\n\nStatistics Sweden was established in 1858. At the start, its operations focused mainly on population statistics, but gradually other areas of statistics were added, such as agricultural statistics, statistics on local government finances, savings banks and relief to the poor.\n\nThe Tables Commission ceased to exist in 1858 and was replaced by the Statistical Committee, a body that advised and coordinated official statistics. The number of members was set at nine, with the Minister of Public Administration serving as Chairman and the Head of Statistics Sweden as Secretary.\n\nIn 1886, the Statistical Committee was replaced by the Statistical Tables Commission, which continued to operate until 1948, when it was formally dissolved. The Head of Statistics Sweden chaired the Commission.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, various government agencies produced statistics in their different subject matter areas.\n\n1962 marked the beginning of centralisation for public statistics. Statistics Sweden was given responsibility for statistics in most of the sectors of society and was radically enlarged and reorganised. In 1965 Statistics Sweden acquired a Governing Council and a Scientific Council.\n\nDuring all this time, Statistics Sweden had been located in Stockholm. However, in 1968 Statistics Sweden began to relocate some of its operations to \u00d6rebro. Today more than half of the staff is situated in \u00d6rebro, while the Director General\u2019s office is in Stockholm. Reorganisations have taken place in 1971, 1976, 1984, 1993, 1998 and 2006.\n\nOn 1 July 1994 the responsibility for official statistics in specific sectoral areas was transferred from Statistics Sweden to 24 other government agencies. Statistics Sweden continued to be responsible for multi-sectoral statistics and statistics of a general nature such as the national accounts, population statistics and labour force statistics.  \n\nOne of the main purposes of the reform was to give users more influence over the statistics. It was expected that the reform would result in greater relevance of the statistics for their users, more flexibility of the statistical system and improved efficiency of statistics production. \n\nIn accordance with its directives, Statistics Sweden had already been responsible for coordinating and monitoring official statistics. This role was strengthened somewhat, e.g. in that all the agencies are requested to submit annual descriptions of their statistical products to Statistics Sweden. \n\nIn 1998, an evaluation of the statistics reform of 1994 was made. The evaluation showed that official statistics continued to function efficiently after the reform. However, coordination and the overall view of the statistical system had suffered. The evaluation report recommended that a council for Sweden\u2019s official statistics should be established to improve coordination and the overall view of the statistical system. \n\nA Council for Official Statistics was duly established in 2002. The Council, which is an advisory body to the Director General of Statistics Sweden who also chairs the Council, shall consider matters of principles regarding the availability, quality and usefulness of the official statistics, as well as issues on facilitating the response process for data providers. The Council shall prepare an annual report on the official statistics, compile an annual publishing plan, and maintain a register of the statistical agencies and their products. The Council shall also work for cooperation between the statistical agencies, and develop and administer a statistics network.\n\nThe Official Statistics Act contains rules concerning areas of application, purpose and designation of official statistics, obligation to provide information, processing of personal data, deletion of information, information to the registered person, appeals, penalties and fines in case of non-compliance with the obligation to provide information."

Statistics Sweden provides access to data that does not allow direct or indirect identification of individuals or of other data subjects such as enterprises. In addition to laws and regulations on data confidentiality, Statistics Sweden follows a screening procedure requiring a written application from the researcher. In the application the researcher is required to describe the project, the variables and periods during which data are used in the research, and also to specify the people taking part in the project. If the project involves processing of sensitive personal data the researcher is required to add an approval of a research committee. Both the anonymous and the de-identified data are in principle available for the researcher only for a specified period, for a specified project and for specified people in an institution. When microdata are released to a researcher at a private institute or organisation, Statistics Sweden imposes legal restrictions limiting the researcher\u2019s right to re-communicate or use the information. If data are released to a researcher in another agency (e.g. a university), data will also be confidential at the agency receiving data, according to the Swedish Secrecy Act. In addition, researchers at other agencies normally sign a general confidentiality statement when receiving the data. The main method of giving access to microdata for research has been to deliver the data to the user by sending a micro disc by post. However, since 2005 it is possible for researchers to obtain access to microdata online (remote access)."

                    "Brief history and other relevant background information": "Collecting statistics has a considerably long past in Turkish history. Historical documents show that the Seljuks and the Ilhanids collected information regarding population. Statistical studies began in the early years of the Ottoman Empire. Special importance was given to collecting information on agriculture and land. For this purpose, between the years of 1326-1360 and 1360-1389, several land population censuses were carried out. Later, between 1512-1520, Sultan Selim initiated a general census and had it written into the constitution that it should be repeated every 100 years. The first population census completed during the era of the Ottoman Empire was taken in 1831, during the time of Mahmut II.\n\nFrom the beginning of the 19th century statistical offices were opened with a centralized system in every ministry in Istanbul and in every province and district. Additionally, a committee was formed to control and follow their studies. All statistical duties and services were brought into legal status by the formation of a central statistical council at Bab-i Ali (the Central Office of the Imperial Government). In 1918, a statistical department was established through a new law, and separate statistical activities were combined within the same office. A year later, however, with the cancellation of that law, the old system was maintained until the period of the Turkish Republic.\n\nThe foundation of the present statistical services began with the establishment of \"The Central Statistical Department\" in 1926 after the founding of the Republic and functioned as partially centralized system. In 1930, the title of the department was changed to \"The General Directorate of Statistics\", and \"The National Statistical System\" became centralized. Between the years 1926-1960, this directorate conducted 11 censuses and surveys; we publish many titles on economic, social and cultural subjects.\n\nDue to the need for improvements in the statistical system of the country, Law No:53 was enacted in June 1962 to set up the State Institute of Statistics under the Office of the Prime Minister. In democratic forms of government, information systems facilitate the transmission of verifiable information. It is this characteristic of widely accessible in formation that allows states to integrate into the world system and function effectively. Because of the almost universal recognition of the importance of statistics and the subsequent demand for them, the State Institute of Statistics (SIS) and its functions were further reorganized and rearranged by legal decrees no.219 and no.357 in 1984 and 1989 respectively, taking into consideration Turkey's newly emerging needs and circumstances.\n\nIn the context of compliance to European Union requirements, a new Statistics Law was enacted in November 2005, and the name of the State Institute of Statistics has been changed to \u201cTurkish Statistical Institute\u201d (TURKSTAT). This new law increased the coordinating role of the Turkish Statistical Institute within the Turkish Statistical System, and strengthened the coordination power of TURKSTAT."

                    "Multi-annual or annual work program": "In Ukraine for the purpose of coordinating the State statistical activity and monitoring its results, the SSCU draws up long-term (as a rule for five-years) and annual plans. Their development directly involves the state statistics bodies and other central executive authorities concerned and scientific and research organizations. \n\nThe long-term plans (programs) specify the strategic direction for statistics development and are rather complex and deal with the reforming of all types of economic activities. They are based on scientific research and development. The compilation of these programs is done through the discussions with the wide public which involve all statistics users concerned. \n\nIn order to advance the role of statistics in the process of the government management, in 1993 the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine approved the Concept to build up Ukraine's national statistics and the State program to accept internationally recognized system for accounting and statistics. The implementation of the Program has been carried out during 1993-1997. The further development of the national statistics was guided by the Program to reform the State statistics until 2003. The Program was approved by the government in 1997.\n\nIn 2004 the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine approved the next long-term program: Strategy for development of the State statistics until 2008. The implementation of this five-year plan foresees the adaptation of Ukraine's statistical system so that it can meet international standards and concepts, namely the EU statistical standards. The sources for financing the implementation of actions stipulated by the Strategy are the State budget of Ukraine and other sources mainly the funds of International Bank for Reconstruction and Development within the project Development of the State Statistics System and Monitoring of Social and Economic Transformations. Besides, a number of actions is carried out within EU (TACIS) technical assistance program and the UK Ministry on international development (DFID), etc. To give practical effect to the Strategy implementation, the SSCU along with other co-actors concerned develop the annual plans of actions that are to be approved by regulations issued by Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. After the end of the reporting year, the SSCU submits the general information about the results of the Strategy implementation to the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. \n\nAccording to Ukraine's Law on the State Statistics, every year the SSCU also draws up the Plan for the State statistical observations which reflects the current operations of the State statistics bodies. The implementation of actions envisaged by this Plan is carried out through the funds from Ukraine's budget. Prior to the compilation of the annual Plan, Standing Committee starts its work. The Standing Committee deals with introduction of the forms of the State statistical observations and the SSCU's accounting documentation. The Committee makes decisions on changes to be made to statistical reporting for the next year. The actions stipulated by the Plan are structured according to their contents. Each action specifies the detailed levels for development and dates for fulfilment of operations by regional statistics offices and the SSCU. \n\nThe Plan for the State statistical observations apart from statistical activity of the SSCU reflects the undertakings of some 45 ministries and other central executive authorities in collection and generalization of information and its transfer to the State statistics bodies. The Plan is considered and approved by Board of the SSCU. Then it is submitted for consideration and approval to the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. \n\nOn the basis of the mentioned Plan, the SSCU draws up the technological plan for the State statistical observations which is to be approved by SSCU's Decree. Plans for economic, organizational and check-up work are approved during the meeting of the SSCU's Board.",

                    "Access to administrative data": "In Ukraine the most important dynamic component of infrastructure of the state statistics is the Business Register which was established in 1993. According to the Ukraine's Law \"On the State Statistics\" the task to maintain the Register rests with the state statistical bodies. The Business Register ensures unified state registration of all legal persons and independent branches belonging to legal persons which are located in Ukraine. As of January 1, 2006 the Business Register contains information about more than one million entities. \n\nTo update the Register indicators, administrative information from the state registration authorities is used (data on the setting up of enterprises (local units), the reorganization, changes in the names, addresses, types of ownership, etc.).   Statistical information is also employed:  information is derived from the results of the annual structural surveys of enterprises of all types of activity. \n\nThe Register is maintained at the national and regional levels. The regional registers (27) include enterprises and local units located in the appropriate areas while central register contains information about all legal entities and their branches as the country as a whole. \n\nThe updating of central and regional registers is done daily. As soon as information about the registered legal persons is received it is passed over to the state statistics bodies by the state registrators. Comparison of data from regional registers with those from central is done regularly twice a month. To update the Register monthly, administrative information from the Tax Register is used; to update register quarterly information from the Pension and Social Funds Registers is used.\n\nBy making use of the Register the SSCU ensures the functioning of special interdepartmental information system on exchange on Ukraine's enterprises and organizations data (excluding confidential statistical information). The system is based on common methodological principles. Unified identification code and a system of classification enable the state administrative bodies to exchange data and employ administrative information for the purpose of updating the departmental data bases and registers.\n\nSince 2006, statistical register of natural persons was established in the SSCU for the registration according to Ukraine's Law \"On the State Registration\". This is filled in with administrative registration information in a way similar to legal persons. Also, in order to obtain statistical data on activity of natural persons the dispersonified administrative information from the Tax Register is processed according to special tailor program. \n\nRegistration information from the state registrators, administrative data from administration authorities along with statistical information derived from statistical surveys compliment each other and create environment for introduction of system of the statistics registers of enterprises and natural persons in to the state statistics bodies. This serves as a reliable basis for the conduct of the state statistical observation.\n\nOn the whole, administrative data from the central and local authorities are used for the majority of observation conducted by the state statistics bodies.",

Demand for statistical information is continuously on the rise. \n\nEach month the SSCU prepares a report and a statistical bulletin on social and economic situation in Ukraine, it also prepares bulletins on different types of statistics, a lot of press-releases and express-information based on materials from current statistical reports. In 2005 the SSCU prepared 42 express-information, 52 press-releases, 46 statistical publications, and 101 statistical bulletins. \n\n\nThe SSCU receives a large number of requests both from organizations, establishments, enterprises, and citizens. Information on requests to obtain a small amount of information is provided for free while the rest is to be paid. According to Ukraine's Law \"On the State Statistics\" and the Regulation on Carrying out Statistical Observations and Supply of Paid Services by the State Statistics Bodies, the state statistics bodies have the right to provide statistical information for payment. The provision of the paid services is made by departments of the SSCU, regional statistics offices and the state enterprises \"Information and Analytical Agency\" (Derzhanalitinform). \n\nTHe Derzhanalitinform was sat up in 2000 within the system of the SSCU. It is involved in supply of statistical information for payment, Also, the SSCU has delegated it to disseminate statistical publications. Within the premises of the SSCU there is a book shop where one can buy statistical publications released by the SSCU.  \n\nTo insure an open access to the unpublished statistical data that are not subject to limitations imposed by the legislation, one can get acquainted with information directly in the departments of the SSCU. This service is widely used by researchers, students and newsmen. The supply of such data is free of charge. Besides, one can get acquainted with statistical data published in official publication in the library of the SSCU. \n\nIn order to create the favorable environment where the citizens can enjoy their constitutional rights to be provided with the information, each month the SSCU prepares a report On Social and Economic Situation in Ukraine whose text is monthly published in full in newspaper \"Uryadovy Couryer\" (\"Government Courier\") and is placed on the web site of the SSCU. Also, all press-releases are placed on the web site of the SSCU. \n\nRelease calendar\n\nThe dates for releasing statistical publications of the SSCU are specified in the Plan of the State Statistical Observations (section Information and Publication Activity) which is drawn up every year and approved by Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. Plan of the State Statistical Observations is disseminated through the printed and electronic formats and is placed on the web site of the SSCU and the Internet.

                    "Position in the government": "The Office for National Statistics (ONS) is the executive office of the UK Statistics Authority - a Non-Ministerial Department (NMD) of the UK Government which reports directly to Parliament. The Authority was established on April 1st 2008 when the Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007 came into force. The ONS is the UK Government's single largest statistical producer. It also functions as:\n\u2022  the office of the National Statistician, who is also the UK Statistics Authority's Chief Executive and principal statistical adviser \n\u2022  the UK's National Statistics Institute (NSI), and  \n\u2022  the 'Head Office' of the Government Statistical Service (GSS) \n\nAlthough the ONS is the UK's largest survey house and its main producer of official statistics, it operates within a highly decentralised and devolved statistical system. Official statistics in the UK are produced not only in the ONS but also by statisticians and their staff working in over 30 separate UK Government Departments and Agencies.  Where appropriate, responsibility for the production of official statistics is also devolved to statistical staff working in each of the three Devolved Administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland Apart from Northen Ireland, the statistical staff in each of these organisations , together with those in the ONS, constitute the Government Statistical Service (GSS). Statistical staff in Northen Ireland are not members of the GSS but maintain a close professional association with it.\n\nThe National Statistician is the Head of the GSS. GSS staff who work outide the ONS - either in other UK Government Departments or in each of the two Devolved Administrations in Scotland and Wales - are normally managed by their own Head of Profession for Statistics (HoP), or equivalent. Heads of Profession form a network of senior statisticians across government who are both managerially accountable to their own Department as well as  professionally accountable to the National Statistician acting in her capacity as the Head of the GSS.",
                    "Organizational structure and finance": "The task of producing official statistics in the UK is decentralised and devolved amongst (a) the 30 Government Departments and Agencies which are affiliated to the GSS, (b) a range of other Crown Bodies, and (c) a range of Non-Crown Bodies which have been identified as statistical producers in secondary legislation (namely, 'Official Statistics' Orders). All key official statistics and a wide range of other economic and social statistics are produced by a body of professional statisticians and their staff known as the Government Statistical Service (GSS). A further range of official statistics are produced by officials within government but outside the GSS management framework.\n\nThe Government Statistical Service (GSS) comprises about 6,500 civil servants whose primary function is to collect, analyse and disseminate official statistics. It is also the Civil Service group which produces the bulk of:\n\n\u2022  all those official statistics which have been designated as National Statistics - defined as 'official statistics' which are deemed to be compliant with the UK Statistic Authority's Code of Practice for Official Statistics\n\u2022  other official statistics, analysis, interpretation and advice to the UK Government and Devolved Administrations. \n\nCoordination arrangements between the UK Government and the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are set out in the Statistics Concordat attached to the Memorandum of Understanding between the UK Government and the Devolved Administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The principles of coherence and harmonisation are also emphasised in the Authority's Code of Practice and further guidance is given in underlying guidance.\n\nGovernance of the ONS is effected through two high-level committees:\n\n\u2022  The UK Statistics Authority's own Board provides the top level of governance for the ONS, overseeing its strategic direction, providing leadership and establishing the overall policy framework in which ONS can operate. The Board is comprised of the chair of the Statistics Authority, its seven non-executive members, the UK Statistics Authority's chief executive and two other senior Authority/ONS officials. The Board has two sub-committees, one of which oversees the ONS (the ONS Board), whilst the other (the Committee on Official Statistics) monitors the UK statistical system as a whole  \n\u2022  The ONS Executive Management Group (EMG) is responsible for overseeing and directing the day-to-day management of the office. It is comprised of ONS's Director General, and the Directors responsible for each of the Office's main workstreams. It meets on a monthly basis.\n\nThe senior management of ONS comprises.\n\n(i) The National Statistician who is the Chief Executive of the UK Statistics Authority and who oversees the work of the Director of Policy and International Relations.\n\n(ii) The Director General for ONS who reports to the National Statistician and has overall responsibility for all ONS's statistical outputs, and who oversees the work of:\nthe Director of Economic, Labour and Social Analysis\nthe Director of Surveys and Administrative Sources\nthe Director of Population, Health and Regional Analysis\nthe Director of Census \nthe Director of Corporate Services \nthe Director of Information Management  \nthe Director of Methodology  \nthe Deputy Directors responsible for Business Change and Communication \n\nGovernance of the GSS is effected on a non-managerial and more consensual basis via the network of GSS Heads of Profession. The UK Statistics Authority's Committee on Official Statistics (COS) provides strategic oversight of the GSS and is supported in this role by the National Statistician's UK Statistics Strategy and Planning Committee. Governance of the relationship between the UK Governments Departments and the Devolved Administrations is effected through the Inter-Administration Committee.   \n\nThe UK Statistics Authority and the ONS are funded jointly by Her Majesty's Treasury (HMT) on a five-yearly basis. Funding for statistics produced by the rest of the GSS comes from each of the responsible Departmens which are, themselves, funded by HMT on a three-yearly basis.",
                    "Multi-annual or annual work program": "The ONS publishes, annually, a 3-Year Work Plan covering its own areas of statistical responsibility \n\nTraditionally, the ONS has also published a regular 3-Year Work Programme covering all UK statistics - including those produced by other UK Government Departments and the three Devolved Administrations in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. In the main, this tended to focus on those official statistics designated as 'National Statistics'. The term 'National Statistics' covers a specified set of statistics which are produced in accordance with the UK Statistics Authority's Code of Practice for Statistics and supporting guidance on standards. \n\nIn the past, the National Statistics Work Programme for the forthcoming three years has included: an outline of the strategic direction for National Statistics; a description of some of the major cross-cutting developments; and individual chapters covering proposed developments within each of 12 'National Statistics Themes' - each of which describes distinct areas of national life such as 'The Labour Market', 'Crime and Justice', 'Health and Care', etc.\n\nThe arrangements for co-ordinated statistical work-planning across the UK are currently subject to a far-reaching review."

                    "Legal basis": "Primary Statistical Legislation\n\nOn 1 April 2008 the UK statistical system entered a new era based on statistical legislation. The Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007 established the UK Statistics Board (subsequently renamed the UK Statistics Authority) as an independent body operating at arm's length from government in the form of a Non-Ministerial Department (NMD) directly accountable to the UK Parliament and, in addition, and where appropriate, to the Parliaments/Assemblies in the three Devolved Administrations.\n\nThe Authority's overall objective is to promote and safeguard the production of official statistics that serve the public good. It is also required to safeguard the quality and comprehensiveness of official statistics, and ensure good practice in relation to official statistics.\n\nThe UK Statistics Authority has three main functions:\n\n\u2022  strategic oversight of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) - its executive office \n\u2022  monitoring and reporting on all UK official statistics, wherever produced, and \n\u2022  independent assessment of official statistics against its Code of Practice \n \nMembership of the Authority's Board comprises the Chair of the Authority, seven other non-executive members, and three executive members.\n\nOn the same date, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) was abolished as a Department of Her Majesty's Treasury and an executive agency, and instead became the 'executive office' of the newly-formed UK Statistics Authority.\n\nSecondary Legislation - Pre-release Access Orders\nOn December 1st 2008 the UK Government implemented secondary and supporting legislation (in the form of a Statutory Instrument) which sets out tighter rules governing the granting of pre-release access to official statistics - a matter specifically excluded from the main Statistics Act. The UK Government's Pre-release Access to Official Statistics Order 2008 is complemented by similar Orders introduced by each of the three devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Each of these Orders describes which persons are entitled to have early access to statistics in their final form before release, and for how long. The UK Government's Order restricts pre-release access to 24 hours before release.\n\nSecondary Legislation - Official Statistics Orders \nThe Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007 departed from historical precedent by expanding the boundaries of the \u2018UK statistical system\u2019 well beyond its traditional borders.  Firstly, the Act extended the system to embrace all of the statistical work of Crown Bodies even if those statistics are not produced under the professional management of statisticians in the GSS or by professionals working in the government's other analytical communities. Secondly, it gave Government Ministers the option to extend the definition of \u2018official statistics\u2019 to embrace the statistical work of any of the various arms-length bodies that operate under their jurisdiction, or are linked to their Department in some way. Ministers can exercise this option through secondary legislation i.e. through an Order in Parliament. In so doing, the Act provided a definition of the word 'official', but made  no attempt to define the word 'statistics'.\n \nOther UK legislation relevant to statistics exists in the form of Acts of Parliament which cater for the collection of specific data, such as the 1920 Census Act and the Population (Statistics) Act.\n\nThe 1947 Statistics of Trade Act also instructs the Chancellor of the Exchequer to collect data on the economy through the Office for National Statistics.\n\nOther Acts which impact upon statistics data are the 1999 Data Protection Act, and the 2000 Freedom of Information Act, both of which influence how statistical data held on individuals can be stored and used."

Official statisticians in other government departments also run statistical surveys but, in addition, have access to administrative sources within their Department.\n\nThe Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007 incorporates specific provisions which encourage other government departments to share their data with the ONS more freely, and vice versa. Within this context, a key part of the ONS strategy is to make more extensive use, for statistical purposes, of the data available from the government's administative and management systems and also to bring together administrative data from different sources in order to create more wide-ranging datasets. This requires government-wide initiatives, and will deliver significant benefits (e.g. a reduction in the burden of surveys on businesses and individuals, and an improvement in the richness of data for analytical purposes).",
                    "Data confidentiality": "Specific standards for the prevention of disclosure of confidential statistical information are set out in Principle 5 of the UK Statistics Authority's Code of Practice for Official Statistics. More extensive guidance has been made available in a booklet on 'Confidentiality' which is one of several guidance documents issued by the National Statistician which provide officials with practical adviceon how they should implement the Authority\u2019s Code.\n\nONS has the following framework for protecting confidentiality in micro-data :\n\n- a user describes their need for micro-data to the appropriate ONS data custodian,\n- the custodian describes the purpose, physical security standard, and risks of the release to a dedicated senior management committee,\n- if approval is granted, the details are recorded in a central log and the conditions of access followed up by a support team.\n\nFor aggregated and tabulated data ONS has a statistical disclosure control centre of expertise within its Methodology Group. The centre provides standards and guidance for all work areas, including a checklist for identifying potentially disclosive data. \n(b) A very firm line is taken on the disclosure of individual information for non-statistical purposes. The Code of Practice requires that where it appears the law requires statistical information to be used for non-statistical purposes (for example, as evidence in a court of law) the release of data will only be on the explicit direction and personal responsibility of the National Statistician. To date no identifiable data has been supplied despite court orders, pleading the confidentiality guarantee and the special nature and significance of individual statistical records."

These archives provide a service to the academic community. The archives satisfy the great majority of academic research needs. Where for a specific statistical purpose it is necessary to access identifiable micro-data, then the users can apply to ONS and the Micro-data Release Panel will consider and approve the access.\n\nMost access is through release to the users' sites. As the data is sometimes disclosive, protection is through careful study of the conditions under which the data will be kept, and through data access agreements and/or contracts. ONS has very limited remote access facilities. For sensitive data sources such as some business data, and longitudinal study data, an on-site controlled access facility is offered.\n\nONS has a long and successful history is putting a very large amount of micro-data into the research community, either directly or through respected data archives."

                    "Brief history and other relevant background information": "Fact-finding is one of America's oldest activities. In the early 1600s, a census was taken in Virginia, and people were counted in nearly all of the British colonies that later became the United States.\n\nFollowing independence, there was an almost immediate need for a census of the entire nation. The first census was taken in 1790, under the responsibility of Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson. That census, taken by U.S. marshals on horseback, counted 3.9 million inhabitants.\n\nAs America grew, the nation's interests grew more complex. The country needed statistics to help people understand what was happening and to plan for growth, and the content of the decennial census changed accordingly. In 1810, the census was expanded to obtain information on the manufacturing, quantity and value of products. In 1840, the census added questions on fisheries. And, in 1850, the census collected data on issues such as taxation, churches, pauperism and crime.\n\nOver the decades, censuses spread to new states and areas under U.S. sovereignty or jurisdiction. There were so many inquiries and so many new geographic entities in the census of 1880 that it took almost a full decade to tabulate and publish the results. This led to the first use of tabulating machines in the 1890 census, which counted nearly 63 million people. These punch-card machines, invented by former Census Bureau employee Herman Hollerith, evolved into computers when Hollerith founded what was to become the IBM Corp. Throughout its existence as the oldest and largest federal statistical agency, the Census Bureau has played a pioneering role in the use of technology to fulfill its role as \"America's Fact Finder.\" \n\nAs America grew, changes in the economy became more frequent and far-reaching. Since government officials and businesses had to adjust their plans as these changes occurred, they needed more frequent reports on them. To meet these needs, the Census Bureau became a permanent institution by an act of Congress in 1902. \n\nToday, in addition to taking a census of the population every 10 years, the Census Bureau conducts censuses of economic activity and state and local governments every five years. And every year, the Census Bureau conducts more than 100 other surveys."

Agencies such as the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics have a confidentiality officer who ensures that employees receive training on the proper handling of confidential data and follow those practices.  Furthermore, individually identifiable data is typically kept in a secure place and separated from other data used for analysis.\n\nSeveral statistical agencies, such as the U.S. Census Bureau, have Disclosure Review Boards that review all statistical publications and microdata files prior to dissemination to ensure that individually identifiable information is not being disclosed or cannot reasonably be inferred through tabular reports or variables in microdata files.\n\nTo provide assistance to the many statistical agencies that handle confidential statistical data, an interagency committee, the Confidentiality and Data Access Committee, has developed a checklist for the disclosure potential of data releases and other materials such as brochures, presentations, and training materials on confidentiality. These materials are widely used within and outside the U.S. and are available on their web site, www.fcsm.gov/committees/cdac/cdac.html."

                    "Availability of microdata for research purposes": "There are several modes in the United States for providing restricted access to confidential data while limiting the risk of their disclosure.  The U.S. Census Bureau pioneered Research Data Centers, or RDCs.  The RDCs permit restricted use of confidential files at secure sites under Census Bureau control, using limited access to dedicated computing equipment and enhanced physical and computer security.  Access to an RDC facility is given only to Census Bureau employees or other persons with Special Sworn Status (SSS) who are approved to use the facility-including researchers carrying out active, approved projects at the RDC.  To be granted SSS, a researcher must have an approved project, obtain a security clearance, and sign the Census Bureau's standard sworn agreement to preserve the confidentiality of the data.   Persons with SSS are subject to the same legal penalties for revealing confidential information as are regular Census Bureau employees-up to a $250,000 fine and/or five years in prison.\n\nThere have also been several successful 'remote access' facilities for confidential data.  This option is currently being offered by the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics.  Researchers can remotely submit statistical programs to a centralized site, which runs the programs on confidential data, and the results are sent back to the researcher via e-mail.  Certain procedures are not permitted, such as those that would allow an investigator to print out individual cases, and output is scanned before being forwarded to the researcher.  These restrictions are designed to reduce to an acceptable minimum the risk of identification or of disclosure.\n\nAnother avenue that has been used by the U.S. National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) is to license researchers to allow them access to confidential data. Researchers must submit a formal proposal and include a security plan that meets the requirements of NCES.  The researcher must sign an affidavit of disclosure, and the license itself must be signed by the researcher and a ranking individual who can legally bind the institution to the agreement, which in the case of a university is someone at the Dean's level or higher.  On-site inspections are also conducted by NCES to insure that the proper security procedures are being followed.  Finally, researchers must send copies of papers based on such data to NCES for disclosure review prior to publication.\n\nOn December 17, 2002, President Bush signed into law the Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act of 2002.  The law provides that data or information acquired by an agency under a pledge of confidentiality and for exclusively statistical purposes shall be used by officers, employees, or agents of the agency exclusively for statistical purposes, and shall not be disclosed by an agency in identifiable form, for any use other than an exclusively statistical purpose, except with the informed consent of the respondent."

                    "Brief history and other relevant background information": "Before 1871, official statistics in Venezuela were compiled by several government and other organizations, but none of them specialized in statistics. In 1871 a combination of factors generated the birth of the Statistical System of Venezuela and the beginning of the history of the present Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica.\n\no\t9 January 1871, a directorate for (initially agricultural) statistics was created within the Ministry of Development. A Statistical Regulation was adopted. A High Council for Statistics was established, composed of the President of the Republic and the Ministers of State. All public officials were obliged to submit statistical data for their area of work, and to fulfill a role in the General Census of the Republic. Bishops were ordered to supply those data that were not part of the public sector. A Statistical Yearbook was published. Also, an Annual Statistical Plan was made up.\n\no\tThe first Census of the Population was held on 1873. The second one was in 1881, the third in 1891.\n\no\tAfter 1936 and particularly after the Law on Statistics and National Censuses was adopted in 1944, the government showed new interest in statistical matters. The Law described the obligation of all public bodies and of the population to submit the information that was required for statistical purposes. The Law assigned the collection, elaboration and dissemination of statistical information to the General Directorate for Statistics. The rule to have a decennial census, from 1950 onwards, was also stipulated in the Law.  Until 1 January 1978, statistics were the responsibility of the Ministry of Development. 21 December 1977, however, the Office for Statistics and Informatics (OCEI) was created, directly under the President of the Republic and the Council of Ministers. \n\nFrom 1991, the planning of statistical work is part of the Social Development Programme (PDS), which is supported by the World bank. Significant investments have been made in technological infrastructure and human capabilities. New databases have been developed, an internal reorganisation of OCEI has been implemented and dissemination of statistical information has been improved through the establishment (1995) of the Oficina de Promoci\u00f3n de Servicios de Informaci\u00f3n. In addition, the information flows between local authorities and the national government level have been restructured and a GIS has been set up.\n\nIn 1997, with the assistance of UNDP, a new Law on Statistics and National Censuses  was drafted, which was approved by the National Assembly in May 2001, as the Ley de la Funci\u00f3n P\u00fablica Estad\u00edstica (Law on Public Statistics)."

                    "Position in the government": "The Department of Census and Statistics, commonly known, as the Central Statistical Office (CSO), is a Government Department under the Ministry of Finance and National Planning (MFNP). The department is responsible for coordinating all statistical activities in the country and is a major source of official statistics.\n\nUnder the Public Sector Reform Programme (PSRP) it was felt that the CSO should be transformed into an Autonomous Agency. This was to make it self accountable and responsive to needs of users in a more effective and efficient manner. This process required that the Act under which the CSO operates be repealed and amended to take into account the added responsibilities.\n\nBecause of the lengthy procedural requirement to implement the transformation of CSO, it was in the interim re-structured under the Public Sector Reform Programme (PSRP). However, the idea of transforming it into a Autonomous Agency is on going and the draft amended Act is still being reviewed by relevant authorities. It is hoped that a new legal framework will be put in place this year (2004).",
                    "Organizational structure and finance": "The CSO is currently headed by a Director and is divided into four broadly defined statistical subject-matter Divisions, namely:\n\no\tEconomic and Financial Statistics Division;\n\no\tSocial Statistics Division;\n\no\tAgriculture and Environment Statistics Division;\n\no\tResearch, Dissemination and Data Processing Division\n\nEach Division is headed by a Deputy Director who is responsible for respective sectoral statistical production. Divisions are further sub-divided into Branches and Sections. Besides the subject-matter Branches and Sections, there are Units which are referred to as Service Units and principally service the day-to-day operations of subject-matter Divisions. These are: Field Surveys; Administration; Transport; Accounts; Internal Audit; and Security.\n\nCSO has its headquarters in Lusaka, along Nationalist Road opposite the University Teaching Hospital (UTH). The department also has offices in all the nine (9) provincial capitals of Zambia and some selected districts in each province. Provincial offices are mainly responsible for Data collection, Manual Editing and Data Entry.",
                    "Main duties": "The main mission and goal of CSO is to provide for a comprehensive National Statistical Database yielding timely, relevant and high quality statistical information to institutions of the Government, Private sector and the wider national and international community CSO has the responsibility of promoting increased utilization of statistical information for effective decision making and informed debate on the economy by all major stakeholders."
